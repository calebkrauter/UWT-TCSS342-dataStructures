About Calculus Volume 3
Calculus is designed for the typical two- or three-semester general calculus course, incorporating innovative features to
enhance student learning. The book guides students through the core concepts of calculus and helps them understand
how those concepts apply to their lives and the world around them. Due to the comprehensive nature of the material,
we are offering the book in three volumes for flexibility and efficiency. Volume 3 covers parametric equations and polar
coordinates, vectors, functions of several variables, multiple integration, and second-order differential equations.

Coverage and scope
Our Calculus Volume 3 textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most general calculus courses nationwide. We have
worked to make calculus interesting and accessible to students while maintaining the mathematical rigor inherent in the
subject. With this objective in mind, the content of the three volumes of Calculus have been developed and arranged to
provide a logical progression from fundamental to more advanced concepts, building upon what students have already
learned and emphasizing connections between topics and between theory and applications. The goal of each section is to
enable students not just to recognize concepts, but work with them in ways that will be useful in later courses and future
careers. The organization and pedagogical features were developed and vetted with feedback from mathematics educators
dedicated to the project.

Pedagogical foundation
Throughout Calculus Volume 3 you will find examples and exercises that present classical ideas and techniques as well as
modern applications and methods. Derivations and explanations are based on years of classroom experience on the part
of long-time calculus professors, striving for a balance of clarity and rigor that has proven successful with their students.
Motivational applications cover important topics in probability, biology, ecology, business, and economics, as well as areas
of physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science. Student Projects in each chapter give students opportunities to
explore interesting sidelights in pure and applied mathematics, from navigating a banked turn to adapting a moon landing
vehicle for a new mission to Mars. Chapter Opening Applications pose problems that are solved later in the chapter, using
the ideas covered in that chapter. Problems include the average distance of Halley's Comment from the Sun, and the vector
field of a hurricane. Definitions, Rules, and Theorems are highlighted throughout the text, including over 60 Proofs of
theorems.

Assessments that reinforce key concepts
In-chapter Examples walk students through problems by posing a question, stepping out a solution, and then asking students
to practice the skill with a “Checkpoint” question. The book also includes assessments at the end of each chapter so
students can apply what they’ve learned through practice problems. Many exercises are marked with a [T] to indicate they
are suitable for solution by technology, including calculators or Computer Algebra Systems (CAS). Answers for selected
exercises are available in the Answer Key at the back of the book. The book also includes assessments at the end of each
chapter so students can apply what they’ve learned through practice problems.

Early or late transcendentals
The three volumes of Calculus are designed to accommodate both Early and Late Transcendental approaches to calculus.
Exponential and logarithmic functions are introduced informally in Chapter 1 of Volume 1 and presented in more rigorous
terms in Chapter 6 in Volume 1 and Chapter 2 in Volume 2. Differentiation and integration of these functions is covered in
Chapters 3–5 in Volume 1 and Chapter 1 in Volume 2 for instructors who want to include them with other types of functions.
These discussions, however, are in separate sections that can be skipped for instructors who prefer to wait until the integral
definitions are given before teaching the calculus derivations of exponentials and logarithms.

Introduction
The chambered nautilus is a fascinating creature. This animal feeds on hermit crabs, fish, and other crustaceans. It has a
hard outer shell with many chambers connected in a spiral fashion, and it can retract into its shell to avoid predators. When
part of the shell is cut away, a perfect spiral is revealed, with chambers inside that are somewhat similar to growth rings in
a tree.
The mathematical function that describes a spiral can be expressed using rectangular (or Cartesian) coordinates. However,
if we change our coordinate system to something that works a bit better with circular patterns, the function becomes much
simpler to describe. The polar coordinate system is well suited for describing curves of this type. How can we use this
coordinate system to describe spirals and other radial figures? (See Example 1.14.)
In this chapter we also study parametric equations, which give us a convenient way to describe curves, or to study the
position of a particle or object in two dimensions as a function of time. We will use parametric equations and polar
coordinates for describing many topics later in this text.

1.1 | Parametric Equations
Learning Objectives
1.1.1 Plot a curve described by parametric equations.
1.1.2 Convert the parametric equations of a curve into the form y = f (x).
1.1.3 Recognize the parametric equations of basic curves, such as a line and a circle.
1.1.4 Recognize the parametric equations of a cycloid.
In this section we examine parametric equations and their graphs. In the two-dimensional coordinate system, parametric
equations are useful for describing curves that are not necessarily functions. The parameter is an independent variable that
both x and y depend on, and as the parameter increases, the values of x and y trace out a path along a plane curve. For
example, if the parameter is t (a common choice), then t might represent time. Then x and y are defined as functions of time,
and ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠ can describe the position in the plane of a given object as it moves along a curved path.

Parametric Equations and Their Graphs
Consider the orbit of Earth around the Sun. Our year lasts approximately 365.25 days, but for this discussion we will use
365 days. On January 1 of each year, the physical location of Earth with respect to the Sun is nearly the same, except for
leap years, when the lag introduced by the extra 1 day of orbiting time is built into the calendar. We call January 1 “day 1”

4

of the year. Then, for example, day 31 is January 31, day 59 is February 28, and so on.
The number of the day in a year can be considered a variable that determines Earth’s position in its orbit. As Earth revolves
around the Sun, its physical location changes relative to the Sun. After one full year, we are back where we started, and a
new year begins. According to Kepler’s laws of planetary motion, the shape of the orbit is elliptical, with the Sun at one
focus of the ellipse. We study this idea in more detail in Conic Sections.

Figure 1.2 Earth’s orbit around the Sun in one year.

Figure 1.2 depicts Earth’s orbit around the Sun during one year. The point labeled F 2 is one of the foci of the ellipse; the
other focus is occupied by the Sun. If we superimpose coordinate axes over this graph, then we can assign ordered pairs to
each point on the ellipse (Figure 1.3). Then each x value on the graph is a value of position as a function of time, and each
y value is also a value of position as a function of time. Therefore, each point on the graph corresponds to a value of Earth’s
position as a function of time.

Figure 1.3 Coordinate axes superimposed on the orbit of
Earth.

We can determine the functions for x(t) and y(t), thereby parameterizing the orbit of Earth around the Sun. The variable

t is called an independent parameter and, in this context, represents time relative to the beginning of each year.
A curve in the (x, y) plane can be represented parametrically. The equations that are used to define the curve are called
parametric equations.

If x and y are continuous functions of t on an interval I, then the equations

x = x(t) and y = y(t)
are called parametric equations and t is called the parameter. The set of points (x, y) obtained as t varies over the

10

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

interval I is called the graph of the parametric equations. The graph of parametric equations is called a parametric
curve or plane curve, and is denoted by C.
Notice in this definition that x and y are used in two ways. The first is as functions of the independent variable t. As t varies
over the interval I, the functions x(t) and y(t) generate a set of ordered pairs (x, y). This set of ordered pairs generates the
graph of the parametric equations. In this second usage, to designate the ordered pairs, x and y are variables. It is important
to distinguish the variables x and y from the functions x(t) and y(t).

Example 1.1
Graphing a Parametrically Defined Curve
Sketch the curves described by the following parametric equations:
a.

x(t) = t − 1,

y(t) = 2t + 4,

−3 ≤ t ≤ 2

b.

x(t) = t 2 − 3,

y(t) = 2t + 1,

−2 ≤ t ≤ 3

c.

x(t) = 4 cos t,

y(t) = 4 sin t,

0 ≤ t ≤ 2π

Solution
a. To create a graph of this curve, first set up a table of values. Since the independent variable in both x(t)
and y(t) is t, let t appear in the first column. Then x(t) and y(t) will appear in the second and third
columns of the table.

The second and third columns in this table provide a set of points to be plotted. The graph of these points
appears in Figure 1.4. The arrows on the graph indicate the orientation of the graph, that is, the direction
that a point moves on the graph as t varies from −3 to 2.

The second and third columns in this table give a set of points to be plotted (Figure 1.5). The first point
on the graph (corresponding to t = −2) has coordinates (1, −3), and the last point (corresponding
to t = 3) has coordinates (6, 7). As t progresses from −2 to 3, the point on the curve travels along a
parabola. The direction the point moves is again called the orientation and is indicated on the graph.

The graph of this plane curve appears in the following graph.

Figure 1.6 Graph of the plane curve described by the
parametric equations in part c.

This is the graph of a circle with radius 4 centered at the origin, with a counterclockwise orientation. The
starting point and ending points of the curve both have coordinates (4, 0).

1.1

Sketch the curve described by the parametric equations

x(t) = 3t + 2,

y(t) = t 2 − 1,

−3 ≤ t ≤ 2.

Eliminating the Parameter
To better understand the graph of a curve represented parametrically, it is useful to rewrite the two equations as a single
equation relating the variables x and y. Then we can apply any previous knowledge of equations of curves in the plane to
identify the curve. For example, the equations describing the plane curve in Example 1.1b. are

x(t) = t 2 − 3,

y(t) = 2t + 1,

−2 ≤ t ≤ 3.

Solving the second equation for t gives

t=

y−1
.

This can be substituted into the first equation:

y 2 − 2y + 1
y 2 − 2y − 11
⎛y − 1 ⎞
x=⎝
−3=
−3=
.
⎠

This equation describes x as a function of y. These steps give an example of eliminating the parameter. The graph of this
function is a parabola opening to the right. Recall that the plane curve started at (1, −3) and ended at (6, 7). These
terminations were due to the restriction on the parameter t.

14

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

Example 1.2
Eliminating the Parameter
Eliminate the parameter for each of the plane curves described by the following parametric equations and describe
the resulting graph.
a.

x(t) = 2t + 4,

y(t) = 2t + 1,

−2 ≤ t ≤ 6

b.

x(t) = 4 cos t,

y(t) = 3 sin t,

0 ≤ t ≤ 2π

Solution
a. To eliminate the parameter, we can solve either of the equations for t. For example, solving the first
equation for t gives

x = 2t + 4
x 2 = 2t + 4
x 2 − 4 = 2t
2
t = x − 4.
2
2
Note that when we square both sides it is important to observe that x ≥ 0. Substituting t = x − 4 this

2

into y(t) yields

y(t) = 2t + 1

⎛ 2

⎞

y = 2⎝x − 4 ⎠ + 1
2
y = x2 − 4 + 1

y = x 2 − 3.

This is the equation of a parabola opening upward. There is, however, a domain restriction because
of the limits on the parameter t. When t = −2,
x = 2(−2) + 4 = 0, and when t = 6,

x = 2(6) + 4 = 4. The graph of this plane curve follows.

parametric equations in part a.

b. Sometimes it is necessary to be a bit creative in eliminating the parameter. The parametric equations for
this example are

x(t) = 4 cos t and y(t) = 3 sin t.
Solving either equation for t directly is not advisable because sine and cosine are not one-to-one functions.
However, dividing the first equation by 4 and the second equation by 3 (and suppressing the t) gives us

y
cos t = x and sin t = .

Now use the Pythagorean identity cos 2 t + sin 2 t = 1 and replace the expressions for sin t and cos t
with the equivalent expressions in terms of x and y. This gives

As t progresses from 0 to 2π, a point on the curve traverses the ellipse once, in a counterclockwise
direction. Recall from the section opener that the orbit of Earth around the Sun is also elliptical. This is a
perfect example of using parameterized curves to model a real-world phenomenon.

1.2 Eliminate the parameter for the plane curve defined by the following parametric equations and describe
the resulting graph.
x(t) = 2 + 3t ,

y(t) = t − 1,

2≤t≤6

So far we have seen the method of eliminating the parameter, assuming we know a set of parametric equations that describe
a plane curve. What if we would like to start with the equation of a curve and determine a pair of parametric equations for
that curve? This is certainly possible, and in fact it is possible to do so in many different ways for a given curve. The process
is known as parameterization of a curve.

Example 1.3
Parameterizing a Curve
Find two different pairs of parametric equations to represent the graph of y = 2x 2 − 3.

Solution
First, it is always possible to parameterize a curve by defining x(t) = t, then replacing x with t in the equation
for y(t). This gives the parameterization

x(t) = t,

y(t) = 2t 2 − 3.

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

17

Since there is no restriction on the domain in the original graph, there is no restriction on the values of t.
We have complete freedom in the choice for the second parameterization. For example, we can choose
x(t) = 3t − 2. The only thing we need to check is that there are no restrictions imposed on x; that is, the range
of x(t) is all real numbers. This is the case for x(t) = 3t − 2. Now since y = 2x 2 − 3, we can substitute

x(t) = 3t − 2 for x. This gives
y(t) = 2(3t − 2) 2 − 2

= 2⎛⎝9t 2 − 12t + 4⎞⎠ − 2

= 18t 2 − 24t + 8 − 2
= 18t 2 − 24t + 6.
Therefore, a second parameterization of the curve can be written as

x(t) = 3t − 2 and y(t) = 18t 2 − 24t + 6.

1.3

Find two different sets of parametric equations to represent the graph of y = x 2 + 2x.

Cycloids and Other Parametric Curves
Imagine going on a bicycle ride through the country. The tires stay in contact with the road and rotate in a predictable
pattern. Now suppose a very determined ant is tired after a long day and wants to get home. So he hangs onto the side of
the tire and gets a free ride. The path that this ant travels down a straight road is called a cycloid (Figure 1.9). A cycloid
generated by a circle (or bicycle wheel) of radius a is given by the parametric equations

x(t) = a(t − sin t),

y(t) = a(1 − cos t).

To see why this is true, consider the path that the center of the wheel takes. The center moves along the x-axis at a constant
height equal to the radius of the wheel. If the radius is a, then the coordinates of the center can be given by the equations

x(t) = at,

y(t) = a

for any value of t. Next, consider the ant, which rotates around the center along a circular path. If the bicycle is moving
from left to right then the wheels are rotating in a clockwise direction. A possible parameterization of the circular motion of
the ant (relative to the center of the wheel) is given by

x(t) = −a sin t,

y(t) = −a cos t.

(The negative sign is needed to reverse the orientation of the curve. If the negative sign were not there, we would have to
imagine the wheel rotating counterclockwise.) Adding these equations together gives the equations for the cycloid.

x(t) = a(t − sin t),

y(t) = a(1 − cos t).

Figure 1.9 A wheel traveling along a road without slipping; the point on
the edge of the wheel traces out a cycloid.

Now suppose that the bicycle wheel doesn’t travel along a straight road but instead moves along the inside of a larger wheel,
as in Figure 1.10. In this graph, the green circle is traveling around the blue circle in a counterclockwise direction. A point

18

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

on the edge of the green circle traces out the red graph, which is called a hypocycloid.

Figure 1.10 Graph of the hypocycloid described by the parametric
equations shown.

The general parametric equations for a hypocycloid are
⎛

⎞

x(t) = (a − b) cos t + b cos⎝a − b ⎠ t
b
⎛a − b ⎞
y(t) = (a − b) sin t − b sin⎝
t.
b ⎠
These equations are a bit more complicated, but the derivation is somewhat similar to the equations for the cycloid. In this
case we assume the radius of the larger circle is a and the radius of the smaller circle is b. Then the center of the wheel
travels along a circle of radius a − b. This fact explains the first term in each equation above. The period of the second
trigonometric function in both x(t) and y(t) is equal to 2πb .

a−b

The ratio a is related to the number of cusps on the graph (cusps are the corners or pointed ends of the graph), as illustrated

b

in Figure 1.11. This ratio can lead to some very interesting graphs, depending on whether or not the ratio is rational.
Figure 1.10 corresponds to a = 4 and b = 1. The result is a hypocycloid with four cusps. Figure 1.11 shows some

other possibilities. The last two hypocycloids have irrational values for a . In these cases the hypocycloids have an infinite

b

number of cusps, so they never return to their starting point. These are examples of what are known as space-filling curves.

The Witch of Agnesi
Many plane curves in mathematics are named after the people who first investigated them, like the folium of Descartes
or the spiral of Archimedes. However, perhaps the strangest name for a curve is the witch of Agnesi. Why a witch?
Maria Gaetana Agnesi (1718–1799) was one of the few recognized women mathematicians of eighteenth-century Italy.
She wrote a popular book on analytic geometry, published in 1748, which included an interesting curve that had been
studied by Fermat in 1630. The mathematician Guido Grandi showed in 1703 how to construct this curve, which he
later called the “versoria,” a Latin term for a rope used in sailing. Agnesi used the Italian term for this rope, “versiera,”
but in Latin, this same word means a “female goblin.” When Agnesi’s book was translated into English in 1801, the
translator used the term “witch” for the curve, instead of rope. The name “witch of Agnesi” has stuck ever since.
The witch of Agnesi is a curve defined as follows: Start with a circle of radius a so that the points (0, 0) and (0, 2a)
are points on the circle (Figure 1.12). Let O denote the origin. Choose any other point A on the circle, and draw the
secant line OA. Let B denote the point at which the line OA intersects the horizontal line through (0, 2a). The vertical
line through B intersects the horizontal line through A at the point P. As the point A varies, the path that the point P
travels is the witch of Agnesi curve for the given circle.
Witch of Agnesi curves have applications in physics, including modeling water waves and distributions of spectral
lines. In probability theory, the curve describes the probability density function of the Cauchy distribution. In this
project you will parameterize these curves.

Figure 1.12 As the point A moves around the circle, the point P traces out the witch of
Agnesi curve for the given circle.

1. On the figure, label the following points, lengths, and angle:
a. C is the point on the x-axis with the same x-coordinate as A.
b. x is the x-coordinate of P, and y is the y-coordinate of P.
c. E is the point (0, a).
d. F is the point on the line segment OA such that the line segment EF is perpendicular to the line segment
OA.
e. b is the distance from O to F.
f. c is the distance from F to A.
g. d is the distance from O to B.
h.

θ is the measure of angle ∠COA.

The goal of this project is to parameterize the witch using θ as a parameter. To do this, write equations for x
and y in terms of only θ.

Travels with My Ant: The Curtate and Prolate Cycloids
Earlier in this section, we looked at the parametric equations for a cycloid, which is the path a point on the edge of a
wheel traces as the wheel rolls along a straight path. In this project we look at two different variations of the cycloid,
called the curtate and prolate cycloids.
First, let’s revisit the derivation of the parametric equations for a cycloid. Recall that we considered a tenacious ant
trying to get home by hanging onto the edge of a bicycle tire. We have assumed the ant climbed onto the tire at the very
edge, where the tire touches the ground. As the wheel rolls, the ant moves with the edge of the tire (Figure 1.13).
As we have discussed, we have a lot of flexibility when parameterizing a curve. In this case we let our parameter t
represent the angle the tire has rotated through. Looking at Figure 1.13, we see that after the tire has rotated through
an angle of t, the position of the center of the wheel, C = (x C, y C), is given by

x C = at and y C = a.
Furthermore, letting A = (x A, y A) denote the position of the ant, we note that

x C − x A = a sin t and y C − y A = a cos t.
Then

x A = x C − a sin t = at − a sin t = a(t − sin t)
y A = y C − a cos t = a − a cos t = a(1 − cos t).

Figure 1.13 (a) The ant clings to the edge of the bicycle tire as the tire rolls along
the ground. (b) Using geometry to determine the position of the ant after the tire has
rotated through an angle of t.

Note that these are the same parametric representations we had before, but we have now assigned a physical meaning
to the parametric variable t.
After a while the ant is getting dizzy from going round and round on the edge of the tire. So he climbs up one of the
spokes toward the center of the wheel. By climbing toward the center of the wheel, the ant has changed his path of
motion. The new path has less up-and-down motion and is called a curtate cycloid (Figure 1.14). As shown in the
figure, we let b denote the distance along the spoke from the center of the wheel to the ant. As before, we let t represent
the angle the tire has rotated through. Additionally, we let C = (x C, y C) represent the position of the center of the
wheel and A = (x A, y A) represent the position of the ant.

Figure 1.14 (a) The ant climbs up one of the spokes toward the center of the wheel. (b)
The ant’s path of motion after he climbs closer to the center of the wheel. This is called a
curtate cycloid. (c) The new setup, now that the ant has moved closer to the center of the
wheel.

1. What is the position of the center of the wheel after the tire has rotated through an angle of t?
2. Use geometry to find expressions for x C − x A and for y C − y A.
3. On the basis of your answers to parts 1 and 2, what are the parametric equations representing the curtate
cycloid?
Once the ant’s head clears, he realizes that the bicyclist has made a turn, and is now traveling away from his
home. So he drops off the bicycle tire and looks around. Fortunately, there is a set of train tracks nearby, headed
back in the right direction. So the ant heads over to the train tracks to wait. After a while, a train goes by,
heading in the right direction, and he manages to jump up and just catch the edge of the train wheel (without
getting squished!).
The ant is still worried about getting dizzy, but the train wheel is slippery and has no spokes to climb, so he
decides to just hang on to the edge of the wheel and hope for the best. Now, train wheels have a flange to keep
the wheel running on the tracks. So, in this case, since the ant is hanging on to the very edge of the flange, the
distance from the center of the wheel to the ant is actually greater than the radius of the wheel (Figure 1.15).
The setup here is essentially the same as when the ant climbed up the spoke on the bicycle wheel. We let
b denote the distance from the center of the wheel to the ant, and we let t represent the angle the tire has
rotated through. Additionally, we let C = (x C, y C) represent the position of the center of the wheel and

A = (x A, y A) represent the position of the ant (Figure 1.15).
When the distance from the center of the wheel to the ant is greater than the radius of the wheel, his path of
motion is called a prolate cycloid. A graph of a prolate cycloid is shown in the figure.

setup, now that the ant has jumped onto the train wheel. (c) The ant travels along a
prolate cycloid.

4. Using the same approach you used in parts 1– 3, find the parametric equations for the path of motion of the
ant.
5. What do you notice about your answer to part 3 and your answer to part 4?
Notice that the ant is actually traveling backward at times (the “loops” in the graph), even though the train
continues to move forward. He is probably going to be really dizzy by the time he gets home!

1.2 | Calculus of Parametric Curves
Learning Objectives
1.2.1 Determine derivatives and equations of tangents for parametric curves.
1.2.2 Find the area under a parametric curve.
1.2.3 Use the equation for arc length of a parametric curve.
1.2.4 Apply the formula for surface area to a volume generated by a parametric curve.
Now that we have introduced the concept of a parameterized curve, our next step is to learn how to work with this concept
in the context of calculus. For example, if we know a parameterization of a given curve, is it possible to calculate the slope
of a tangent line to the curve? How about the arc length of the curve? Or the area under the curve?
Another scenario: Suppose we would like to represent the location of a baseball after the ball leaves a pitcher’s hand. If
the position of the baseball is represented by the plane curve ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠, then we should be able to use calculus to find
the speed of the ball at any given time. Furthermore, we should be able to calculate just how far that ball has traveled as a
function of time.

Derivatives of Parametric Equations
We start by asking how to calculate the slope of a line tangent to a parametric curve at a point. Consider the plane curve
defined by the parametric equations

x(t) = 2t + 3,

y(t) = 3t − 4,

−2 ≤ t ≤ 3.

The graph of this curve appears in Figure 1.16. It is a line segment starting at (−1, −10) and ending at (9, 5).

We can eliminate the parameter by first solving the equation x(t) = 2t + 3 for t:

Theorem 1.1: Derivative of Parametric Equations
Consider the plane curve defined by the parametric equations x = x(t) and y = y(t). Suppose that x′ (t) and y′ (t)

This theorem can be proven using the Chain Rule. In particular, assume that the parameter t can be eliminated, yielding
a differentiable function y = F(x). Then y(t) = F(x(t)). Differentiating both sides of this equation using the Chain Rule
yields

y′ (t) = F′ (x(t))x′ (t),

□
Equation 1.1 can be used to calculate derivatives of plane curves, as well as critical points. Recall that a critical point of
a differentiable function y = f (x) is any point x = x 0 such that either f ′ (x 0) = 0 or f ′ (x 0) does not exist. Equation
1.1 gives a formula for the slope of a tangent line to a curve defined parametrically regardless of whether the curve can be
described by a function y = f (x) or not.

y(0) = 2(0) − 1 = −1, which corresponds to the point (−3, −1) on the graph. The graph of this curve
is a parabola opening to the right, and the point (−3, −1) is its vertex as shown.

which corresponds to the point (−1, 6) on the graph. When t = 1 we have

x(1) = 2(1) + 1 = 3 and y(1) = (1) 3 − 3(1) + 4 = 1 − 3 + 4 = 2,
which corresponds to the point (3, 2) on the graph. The point (3, 2) is a relative minimum and the point

(−1, 6) is a relative maximum, as seen in the following graph.

Integrals Involving Parametric Equations
Now that we have seen how to calculate the derivative of a plane curve, the next question is this: How do we find the
area under a curve defined parametrically? Recall the cycloid defined by the equations x(t) = t − sin t, y(t) = 1 − cos t.
Suppose we want to find the area of the shaded region in the following graph.

34

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

To derive a formula for the area under the curve defined by the functions

x = x(t),

y = y(t),

a ≤ t ≤ b,

we assume that x(t) is differentiable and start with an equal partition of the interval a ≤ t ≤ b. Suppose

t 0 = a < t 1 < t 2 < ⋯ < t n = b and consider the following graph.

Figure 1.22 Approximating the area under a parametrically
defined curve.

We use rectangles to approximate the area under the curve. The height of a typical rectangle in this parametrization is
–
–
y⎛⎝x⎛⎝ t i⎞⎠⎞⎠ for some value t i in the ith subinterval, and the width can be calculated as x(t i) − x(t i − 1). Thus the area of the
ith rectangle is given by

A i = y⎛⎝x⎛⎝ t i⎞⎠⎞⎠ ⎛⎝x(t i) − x(t i − 1)⎞⎠.
Then a Riemann sum for the area is

Arc Length of a Parametric Curve
In addition to finding the area under a parametric curve, we sometimes need to find the arc length of a parametric curve. In
the case of a line segment, arc length is the same as the distance between the endpoints. If a particle travels from point A to
point B along a curve, then the distance that particle travels is the arc length. To develop a formula for arc length, we start
with an approximation by line segments as shown in the following graph.

36

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

Figure 1.23 Approximation of a curve by line segments.

Given a plane curve defined by the functions x = x(t), y = y(t), a ≤ t ≤ b, we start by partitioning the interval [a, b]
into n equal subintervals: t 0 = a < t 1 < t 2 < ⋯ < t n = b. The width of each subinterval is given by Δt = (b − a)/n. We
can calculate the length of each line segment:

x(t 1) − x(t 0)⎞⎠ 2 + ⎛⎝y(t 1) − y(t 0)⎞⎠ 2

d1 =

⎛
⎝

d2 =

⎛
⎝

x(t 2) − x(t 1)⎞⎠ 2 + ⎛⎝y(t 2) − y(t 1)⎞⎠ 2 etc.

Then add these up. We let s denote the exact arc length and s n denote the approximation by n line segments:

s ≈ ∑ sk = ∑

⎛
⎝

x(t k) − x(t k − 1)⎞⎠ 2 + ⎛⎝y(t k) − y(t k − 1)⎞⎠ 2.

(1.4)

If we assume that x(t) and y(t) are differentiable functions of t, then the Mean Value Theorem (Introduction to the
Applications of Derivatives (http://cnx.org/content/m53602/latest/) ) applies, so in each subinterval [t k − 1, t k]

there exist t k and t̃ k such that

This is a Riemann sum that approximates the arc length over a partition of the interval [a, b]. If we further assume that
the derivatives are continuous and let the number of points in the partition increase without bound, the approximation
approaches the exact arc length. This gives

When taking the limit, the values of t k and t̃ k are both contained within the same ever-shrinking interval of width Δt,
so they must converge to the same value.
We can summarize this method in the following theorem.

Theorem 1.3: Arc Length of a Parametric Curve
Consider the plane curve defined by the parametric equations

y = y(t),

and assume that x(t) and y(t) are differentiable functions of t. Then the arc length of this curve is given by

At this point a side derivation leads to a previous formula for arc length. In particular, suppose the parameter can
be eliminated, leading to a function y = F(x). Then y(t) = F(x(t)) and the Chain Rule gives y′ (t) = F′ (x(t))x′ (t).

We now return to the problem posed at the beginning of the section about a baseball leaving a pitcher’s hand. Ignoring the
effect of air resistance (unless it is a curve ball!), the ball travels a parabolic path. Assuming the pitcher’s hand is at the
origin and the ball travels left to right in the direction of the positive x-axis, the parametric equations for this curve can be
written as

x(t) = 140t,

y(t) = −16t 2 + 2t

where t represents time. We first calculate the distance the ball travels as a function of time. This distance is represented
by the arc length. We can modify the arc length formula slightly. First rewrite the functions x(t) and y(t) using v as an
independent variable, so as to eliminate any confusion with the parameter t:

x(v) = 140v,

y(v) = −16v 2 + 2v.

Surface Area Generated by a Parametric Curve

a function y = f (x) from x = a to x = b, revolved around the x-axis:

Solution
We start with the curve defined by the equations

y(t) = r sin t,

0 ≤ t ≤ π.

This generates an upper semicircle of radius r centered at the origin as shown in the following graph.

When this curve is revolved around the x-axis, it generates a sphere of radius r. To calculate the surface area of

Learning Objectives
1.3.1 Locate points in a plane by using polar coordinates.
1.3.2 Convert points between rectangular and polar coordinates.
1.3.3 Sketch polar curves from given equations.
1.3.4 Convert equations between rectangular and polar coordinates.
1.3.5 Identify symmetry in polar curves and equations.
The rectangular coordinate system (or Cartesian plane) provides a means of mapping points to ordered pairs and ordered
pairs to points. This is called a one-to-one mapping from points in the plane to ordered pairs. The polar coordinate system
provides an alternative method of mapping points to ordered pairs. In this section we see that in some circumstances, polar
coordinates can be more useful than rectangular coordinates.

Defining Polar Coordinates
To find the coordinates of a point in the polar coordinate system, consider Figure 1.27. The point P has Cartesian
coordinates (x, y). The line segment connecting the origin to the point P measures the distance from the origin to P and
has length r. The angle between the positive x -axis and the line segment has measure θ. This observation suggests a
natural correspondence between the coordinate pair (x, y) and the values r and θ. This correspondence is the basis of
the polar coordinate system. Note that every point in the Cartesian plane has two values (hence the term ordered pair)
associated with it. In the polar coordinate system, each point also two values associated with it: r and θ.

Figure 1.27 An arbitrary point in the Cartesian plane.

Using right-triangle trigonometry, the following equations are true for the point P:

cos θ = xr so x = r cos θ
y
sin θ = r so y = r sin θ.
Furthermore,

y
r 2 = x 2 + y 2 and tan θ = x .
Each point (x, y) in the Cartesian coordinate system can therefore be represented as an ordered pair (r, θ) in the polar
coordinate system. The first coordinate is called the radial coordinate and the second coordinate is called the angular
coordinate. Every point in the plane can be represented in this form.
Note that the equation tan θ = y/x has an infinite number of solutions for any ordered pair (x, y). However, if we restrict
the solutions to values between 0 and 2π then we can assign a unique solution to the quadrant in which the original point

(x, y) is located. Then the corresponding value of r is positive, so r 2 = x 2 + y 2.

Theorem 1.4: Converting Points between Coordinate Systems

the following

conversion formulas hold true:

x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ,
y
r 2 = x 2 + y 2 and tan θ = x .

(1.7)

These formulas can be used to convert from rectangular to polar or from polar to rectangular coordinates.

Every point in the plane has an infinite number of representations in polar coordinates. However, each point in the plane has
only one representation in the rectangular coordinate system.
Note that the polar representation of a point in the plane also has a visual interpretation. In particular, r is the directed
distance that the point lies from the origin, and θ measures the angle that the line segment from the origin to the point makes
with the positive x -axis. Positive angles are measured in a counterclockwise direction and negative angles are measured in
a clockwise direction. The polar coordinate system appears in the following figure.

Figure 1.28 The polar coordinate system.

The line segment starting from the center of the graph going to the right (called the positive x-axis in the Cartesian system)
is the polar axis. The center point is the pole, or origin, of the coordinate system, and corresponds to r = 0. The innermost
circle shown in Figure 1.28 contains all points a distance of 1 unit from the pole, and is represented by the equation r = 1.

48

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

Then r = 2 is the set of points 2 units from the pole, and so on. The line segments emanating from the pole correspond
to fixed angles. To plot a point in the polar coordinate system, start with the angle. If the angle is positive, then measure
the angle from the polar axis in a counterclockwise direction. If it is negative, then measure it clockwise. If the value of r
is positive, move that distance along the terminal ray of the angle. If it is negative, move along the ray that is opposite the
terminal ray of the given angle.

Polar Curves
Now that we know how to plot points in the polar coordinate system, we can discuss how to plot curves. In the rectangular
coordinate system, we can graph a function y = f (x) and create a curve in the Cartesian plane. In a similar fashion, we can
graph a curve that is generated by a function r = f (θ).

The general idea behind graphing a function in polar coordinates is the same as graphing a function in rectangular
coordinates. Start with a list of values for the independent variable (θ in this case) and calculate the corresponding values
of the dependent variable r. This process generates a list of ordered pairs, which can be plotted in the polar coordinate
system. Finally, connect the points, and take advantage of any patterns that may appear. The function may be periodic, for
example, which indicates that only a limited number of values for the independent variable are needed.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Plotting a Curve in Polar Coordinates
1. Create a table with two columns. The first column is for θ, and the second column is for r.
2. Create a list of values for θ.
3. Calculate the corresponding r values for each θ.
4. Plot each ordered pair (r, θ) on the coordinate axes.
5. Connect the points and look for a pattern.

polar curves.

Example 1.12
Graphing a Function in Polar Coordinates
Graph the curve defined by the function r = 4 sin θ. Identify the curve and rewrite the equation in rectangular
coordinates.

Solution
Because the function is a multiple of a sine function, it is periodic with period 2π, so use values for θ between
0 and 2π. The result of steps 1–3 appear in the following table. Figure 1.30 shows the graph based on this table.

Figure 1.30 The graph of the function r = 4 sin θ is a circle.

This is the graph of a circle. The equation r = 4 sin θ can be converted into rectangular coordinates by first

multiplying both sides by r. This gives the equation r 2 = 4r sin θ. Next use the facts that r 2 = x 2 + y 2 and

y = r sin θ. This gives x 2 + y 2 = 4y. To put this equation into standard form, subtract 4y from both sides of
the equation and complete the square:

x 2 + y 2 − 4y = 0

x 2 + ⎛⎝y 2 − 4y⎞⎠ = 0

x 2 + ⎛⎝y 2 − 4y + 4⎞⎠ = 0 + 4
x 2 + ⎛⎝y − 2⎞⎠ 2 = 4.
This is the equation of a circle with radius 2 and center (0, 2) in the rectangular coordinate system.

Create a graph of the curve defined by the function r = 4 + 4 cos θ.

The graph in Example 1.12 was that of a circle. The equation of the circle can be transformed into rectangular coordinates
using the coordinate transformation formulas in Equation 1.8. Example 1.14 gives some more examples of functions
for transforming from polar to rectangular coordinates.

c.

r = 6 cos θ − 8 sin θ

Solution
a. Take the tangent of both sides. This gives tan θ = tan(π/3) = 3. Since tan θ = y/x we can replace the
left-hand side of this equation by y/x. This gives y/x = 3, which can be rewritten as y = x 3. This
is the equation of a straight line passing through the origin with slope 3. In general, any polar equation
of the form θ = K represents a straight line through the pole with slope equal to tan K.
b. First, square both sides of the equation. This gives r 2 = 9. Next replace r 2 with x 2 + y 2. This gives
the equation x 2 + y 2 = 9, which is the equation of a circle centered at the origin with radius 3. In
general, any polar equation of the form r = k where k is a positive constant represents a circle of radius
k centered at the origin. (Note: when squaring both sides of an equation it is possible to introduce new
points unintentionally. This should always be taken into consideration. However, in this case we do not
⎛

⎞

⎛

⎞

introduce new points. For example, ⎝−3, π ⎠ is the same point as ⎝3, 4π ⎠.)

c. Multiply both sides of the equation by r. This leads to r 2 = 6r cos θ − 8r sin θ. Next use the formulas

r 2 = x 2 + y 2,

x = r cos θ,

y = r sin θ.

This gives

r 2 = 6(r cos θ) − 8(r sin θ)

x 2 + y 2 = 6x − 8y.

To put this equation into standard form, first move the variables from the right-hand side of the equation
to the left-hand side, then complete the square.

x 2 + y 2 = 6x − 8y

x 2 − 6x + y 2 + 8y = 0

⎝x − 6x + 9⎠ + ⎝y + 8y + 16⎠

= 0
= 9 + 16

(x − 3) 2 + ⎛⎝y + 4⎞⎠ 2 = 25.
This is the equation of a circle with center at (3, −4) and radius 5. Notice that the circle passes through
the origin since the center is 5 units away.

Figure 1.33 Graph of r = 3 sin 3θ.

If the coefficient of θ is even, the graph has twice as many petals as the coefficient. If the coefficient of θ is odd,
then the number of petals equals the coefficient. You are encouraged to explore why this happens. Even more interesting
graphs emerge when the coefficient of θ is not an integer. For example, if it is rational, then the curve is closed; that is,
it eventually ends where it started (Figure 1.34(a)). However, if the coefficient is irrational, then the curve never closes
(Figure 1.34(b)). Although it may appear that the curve is closed, a closer examination reveals that the petals just above
the positive x axis are slightly thicker. This is because the petal does not quite match up with the starting point.

Figure 1.34 Polar rose graphs of functions with (a) rational coefficient and (b) irrational coefficient. Note that
the rose in part (b) would actually fill the entire circle if plotted in full.

Since the curve defined by the graph of r = 3 sin(πθ) never closes, the curve depicted in Figure 1.34(b) is only a partial
depiction. In fact, this is an example of a space-filling curve. A space-filling curve is one that in fact occupies a twodimensional subset of the real plane. In this case the curve occupies the circle of radius 3 centered at the origin.

Chapter Opener: Describing a Spiral
Recall the chambered nautilus introduced in the chapter opener. This creature displays a spiral when half the outer
shell is cut away. It is possible to describe a spiral using rectangular coordinates. Figure 1.35 shows a spiral in
rectangular coordinates. How can we describe this curve mathematically?

Figure 1.35 How can we describe a spiral graph
mathematically?

Solution
As the point P travels around the spiral in a counterclockwise direction, its distance d from the origin increases.
Assume that the distance d is a constant multiple k of the angle θ that the line segment OP makes with the
positive x-axis. Therefore d(P, O) = kθ, where O is the origin. Now use the distance formula and some
trigonometry:

d(P, O) = kθ

Although this equation describes the spiral, it is not possible to solve it directly for either x or y. However, if
we use polar coordinates, the equation becomes much simpler. In particular, d(P, O) = r, and θ is the second
coordinate. Therefore the equation for the spiral becomes r = kθ. Note that when θ = 0 we also have r = 0,
so the spiral emanates from the origin. We can remove this restriction by adding a constant to the equation.
Then the equation for the spiral becomes r = a + kθ for arbitrary constants a and k. This is referred to as an
Archimedean spiral, after the Greek mathematician Archimedes.
Another type of spiral is the logarithmic spiral, described by the function r = a · b θ. A graph of the function

r = 1.2⎛⎝1.25 θ⎞⎠ is given in Figure 1.36. This spiral describes the shell shape of the chambered nautilus.

Suppose a curve is described in the polar coordinate system via the function r = f (θ). Since we have conversion formulas
from polar to rectangular coordinates given by

x = r cos θ
y = r sin θ,
it is possible to rewrite these formulas using the function

x = f (θ) cos θ
y = f (θ) sin θ.
This step gives a parameterization of the curve in rectangular coordinates using θ as the parameter. For example, the spiral
formula r = a + bθ from Figure 1.31 becomes

x = (a + bθ) cos θ
y = (a + bθ) sin θ.
Letting θ range from −∞ to ∞ generates the entire spiral.

Symmetry in Polar Coordinates
When studying symmetry of functions in rectangular coordinates (i.e., in the form y = f (x)), we talk about symmetry
with respect to the y-axis and symmetry with respect to the origin. In particular, if f (−x) = f (x) for all x in the domain
of f , then f is an even function and its graph is symmetric with respect to the y-axis. If f (−x) = − f (x) for all x in the
domain of f , then f is an odd function and its graph is symmetric with respect to the origin. By determining which types
of symmetry a graph exhibits, we can learn more about the shape and appearance of the graph. Symmetry can also reveal
other properties of the function that generates the graph. Symmetry in polar curves works in a similar fashion.

Theorem 1.5: Symmetry in Polar Curves and Equations
Consider a curve generated by the function r = f (θ) in polar coordinates.

58

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

i. The curve is symmetric about the polar axis if for every point (r, θ) on the graph, the point (r, −θ) is also
on the graph. Similarly, the equation r = f (θ) is unchanged by replacing θ with −θ.
ii. The curve is symmetric about the pole if for every point (r, θ) on the graph, the point (r, π + θ) is also on
the graph. Similarly, the equation r = f (θ) is unchanged when replacing r with −r, or θ with π + θ.
iii. The curve is symmetric about the vertical line θ = π if for every point (r, θ) on the graph, the point

2
(r, π − θ) is also on the graph. Similarly, the equation r = f (θ) is unchanged when θ is replaced by π − θ.

The following table shows examples of each type of symmetry.

Example 1.15
Using Symmetry to Graph a Polar Equation
Find the symmetry of the rose defined by the equation r = 3 sin(2θ) and create a graph.

Solution
Suppose the point (r, θ) is on the graph of r = 3 sin(2θ).
i. To test for symmetry about the polar axis, first try replacing θ with −θ. This gives
r = 3 sin(2(−θ)) = −3 sin(2θ). Since this changes the original equation, this test is not satisfied.
However, returning to the original equation and replacing r with −r and θ with π − θ yields

−r = 3 sin(2(π − θ))
−r = 3 sin(2π − 2θ)
−r = 3 sin(−2θ)
−r = −3 sin 2θ.
Multiplying both sides of this equation by −1 gives r = 3 sin 2θ, which is the original equation. This
demonstrates that the graph is symmetric with respect to the polar axis.
ii. To test for symmetry with respect to the pole, first replace r with −r, which yields −r = 3 sin(2θ).
Multiplying both sides by −1 gives r = −3 sin(2θ), which does not agree with the original equation.
Therefore the equation does not pass the test for this symmetry. However, returning to the original
equation and replacing θ with θ + π gives

r = 3 sin(2(θ + π))
= 3 sin(2θ + 2π)
= 3(sin 2θ cos 2π + cos 2θ sin 2π)
= 3 sin 2θ.
Since this agrees with the original equation, the graph is symmetric about the pole.
iii. To test for symmetry with respect to the vertical line θ = π , first replace both r with −r and θ with

−θ.

2

−r = 3 sin(2(−θ))
−r = 3 sin(−2θ)
−r = −3 sin 2θ.
Multiplying both sides of this equation by −1 gives r = 3 sin 2θ, which is the original equation.
Therefore the graph is symmetric about the vertical line θ = π .

2

This graph has symmetry with respect to the polar axis, the origin, and the vertical line going through the pole.
To graph the function, tabulate values of θ between 0 and π/2 and then reflect the resulting graph.

1.4 | Area and Arc Length in Polar Coordinates
Learning Objectives
1.4.1 Apply the formula for area of a region in polar coordinates.
1.4.2 Determine the arc length of a polar curve.
In the rectangular coordinate system, the definite integral provides a way to calculate the area under a curve. In particular,
if we have a function y = f (x) defined from x = a to x = b where f (x) > 0 on this interval, the area between the curve
b

and the x-axis is given by A = ∫ f (x) dx. This fact, along with the formula for evaluating this integral, is summarized in
a

the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Similarly, the arc length of this curve is given by L = ∫

b
a

1 + ⎛⎝ f ′ (x)⎞⎠ 2dx. In this

section, we study analogous formulas for area and arc length in the polar coordinate system.

Areas of Regions Bounded by Polar Curves
We have studied the formulas for area under a curve defined in rectangular coordinates and parametrically defined curves.
Now we turn our attention to deriving a formula for the area of a region bounded by a polar curve. Recall that the proof of
the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus used the concept of a Riemann sum to approximate the area under a curve by using
rectangles. For polar curves we use the Riemann sum again, but the rectangles are replaced by sectors of a circle.
Consider a curve defined by the function r = f (θ), where α ≤ θ ≤ β. Our first step is to partition the interval [α, β] into
n equal-width subintervals. The width of each subinterval is given by the formula Δθ = (β − α)/n, and the ith partition
point θ i is given by the formula θ i = α + iΔθ. Each partition point θ = θ i defines a line with slope tanθ i passing
through the pole as shown in the following graph.

Figure 1.39 A partition of a typical curve in polar coordinates.

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

65

The line segments are connected by arcs of constant radius. This defines sectors whose areas can be calculated by using a
geometric formula. The area of each sector is then used to approximate the area between successive line segments. We then
sum the areas of the sectors to approximate the total area. This approach gives a Riemann sum approximation for the total
area. The formula for the area of a sector of a circle is illustrated in the following figure.

Figure 1.40 The area of a sector of a circle is given by

A = 1 θr 2.
2

Recall that the area of a circle is A = πr 2. When measuring angles in radians, 360 degrees is equal to 2π radians.

Therefore a fraction of a circle can be measured by the central angle θ. The fraction of the circle is given by θ , so the

2π

area of the sector is this fraction multiplied by the total area:

⎛ ⎞
A = ⎝ θ ⎠ πr 2 = 1 θr 2.

Since the radius of a typical sector in Figure 1.39 is given by r i = f ⎛⎝θ i⎞⎠, the area of the ith sector is given by

A i = 1 (Δθ)⎛⎝ f ⎛⎝θ i⎞⎠⎞⎠ 2.

and determine which function defines the outer curve or the inner curve between these two points.

In Example 1.17 we found the area inside the circle and outside the cardioid by first finding their intersection points.

Notice that solving the equation directly for θ yielded two solutions: θ = π and θ = 5π . However, in the graph there are

three intersection points. The third intersection point is the origin. The reason why this point did not show up as a solution
is because the origin is on both graphs but for different values of θ. For example, for the cardioid we get

2 + 2 sin θ = 0
sin θ = −1,
so the values for θ that solve this equation are θ = 3π + 2nπ, where n is any integer. For the circle we get

2

6 sin θ = 0.
The solutions to this equation are of the form θ = nπ for any integer value of n. These two solution sets have no points in
common. Regardless of this fact, the curves intersect at the origin. This case must always be taken into consideration.

In polar coordinates we define the curve by the equation r = f (θ), where α ≤ θ ≤ β. In order to adapt the arc length
formula for a polar curve, we use the equations

x = r cos θ = f (θ) cos θ and y = r sin θ = f (θ) sin θ,
and we replace the parameter t by θ. Then

dx = f ′ (θ) cos θ − f (θ) sin θ

Solution
When θ = 0, r = 2 + 2cos0 = 4. Furthermore, as θ goes from 0 to 2π, the cardioid is traced out exactly
once. Therefore these are the limits of integration. Using f (θ) = 2 + 2cosθ,

Next, using the identity cos(2α) = 2cos 2 α − 1,

add 1 to both sides and multiply by 2. This gives

1.5 | Conic Sections
Learning Objectives
1.5.1 Identify the equation of a parabola in standard form with given focus and directrix.
1.5.2 Identify the equation of an ellipse in standard form with given foci.
1.5.3 Identify the equation of a hyperbola in standard form with given foci.
1.5.4 Recognize a parabola, ellipse, or hyperbola from its eccentricity value.
1.5.5 Write the polar equation of a conic section with eccentricity e .
1.5.6 Identify when a general equation of degree two is a parabola, ellipse, or hyperbola.
Conic sections have been studied since the time of the ancient Greeks, and were considered to be an important mathematical
concept. As early as 320 BCE, such Greek mathematicians as Menaechmus, Appollonius, and Archimedes were fascinated
by these curves. Appollonius wrote an entire eight-volume treatise on conic sections in which he was, for example, able to
derive a specific method for identifying a conic section through the use of geometry. Since then, important applications of
conic sections have arisen (for example, in astronomy), and the properties of conic sections are used in radio telescopes,
satellite dish receivers, and even architecture. In this section we discuss the three basic conic sections, some of their
properties, and their equations.
Conic sections get their name because they can be generated by intersecting a plane with a cone. A cone has two identically
shaped parts called nappes. One nappe is what most people mean by “cone,” having the shape of a party hat. A right circular
cone can be generated by revolving a line passing through the origin around the y-axis as shown.

Figure 1.43 A cone generated by revolving the line y = 3x
around the y -axis.

Conic sections are generated by the intersection of a plane with a cone (Figure 1.44). If the plane is parallel to the axis of
revolution (the y-axis), then the conic section is a hyperbola. If the plane is parallel to the generating line, the conic section
is a parabola. If the plane is perpendicular to the axis of revolution, the conic section is a circle. If the plane intersects one
nappe at an angle to the axis (other than 90°), then the conic section is an ellipse.

74

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

Figure 1.44 The four conic sections. Each conic is determined by the angle the plane makes with the axis of
the cone.

Parabolas
A parabola is generated when a plane intersects a cone parallel to the generating line. In this case, the plane intersects only
one of the nappes. A parabola can also be defined in terms of distances.

Definition
A parabola is the set of all points whose distance from a fixed point, called the focus, is equal to the distance from
a fixed line, called the directrix. The point halfway between the focus and the directrix is called the vertex of the
parabola.
A graph of a typical parabola appears in Figure 1.45. Using this diagram in conjunction with the distance formula, we can
derive an equation for a parabola. Recall the distance formula: Given point P with coordinates (x 1, y 1) and point Q with
coordinates (x 2, y 2), the distance between them is given by the formula

d(P, Q) = (x 2 − x 1) 2 + (y 2 − y 1) 2.
Then from the definition of a parabola and Figure 1.45, we get

d(F, P) = d(P, Q)
2

(0 − x) + (p − y) 2 =

(x − x) 2 + (−p − y) 2.

Squaring both sides and simplifying yields

x 2 + (p − y) 2 = 0 2 + (−p − y) 2

x 2 + p 2 − 2py + y 2 = p 2 + 2py + y 2
x 2 − 2py = 2py

x 2 = 4py.

75

Figure 1.45 A typical parabola in which the distance from the
focus to the vertex is represented by the variable p.

Now suppose we want to relocate the vertex. We use the variables (h, k) to denote the coordinates of the vertex. Then if
the focus is directly above the vertex, it has coordinates ⎛⎝h, k + p⎞⎠ and the directrix has the equation y = k − p. Going
through the same derivation yields the formula (x − h) 2 = 4p⎛⎝y − k⎞⎠. Solving this equation for y leads to the following
theorem.

Theorem 1.8: Equations for Parabolas
Given a parabola opening upward with vertex located at (h, k) and focus located at ⎛⎝h, k + p⎞⎠, where p is a constant,
the equation for the parabola is given by

y = 1 (x − h) 2 + k.
4p

(1.11)

This is the standard form of a parabola.

We can also study the cases when the parabola opens down or to the left or the right. The equation for each of these cases
can also be written in standard form as shown in the following graphs.

76

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

Figure 1.46 Four parabolas, opening in various directions, along with their equations in standard form.

In addition, the equation of a parabola can be written in the general form, though in this form the values of h, k, and p are
not immediately recognizable. The general form of a parabola is written as

ax 2 + bx + cy + d = 0

or

ay 2 + bx + cy + d = 0.

The first equation represents a parabola that opens either up or down. The second equation represents a parabola that opens
either to the left or to the right. To put the equation into standard form, use the method of completing the square.

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

77

Solution
Since y is not squared in this equation, we know that the parabola opens either upward or downward. Therefore
we need to solve this equation for y, which will put the equation into standard form. To do that, first add 8y to
both sides of the equation:

8y = x 2 − 4x + 12.
The next step is to complete the square on the right-hand side. Start by grouping the first two terms on the righthand side using parentheses:

8y = ⎛⎝x 2 − 4x⎞⎠ + 12.
Next determine the constant that, when added inside the parentheses, makes the quantity inside the parentheses
⎛

⎞

2

a perfect square trinomial. To do this, take half the coefficient of x and square it. This gives ⎝−4 ⎠ = 4. Add 4

2

inside the parentheses and subtract 4 outside the parentheses, so the value of the equation is not changed:

8y = ⎛⎝x 2 − 4x + 4⎞⎠ + 12 − 4.
Now combine like terms and factor the quantity inside the parentheses:

8y = (x − 2) 2 + 8.
Finally, divide by 8:

y = 1 (x − 2) 2 + 1.
8
This equation is now in standard form. Comparing this to Equation 1.11 gives h = 2,

k = 1, and p = 2.

The parabola opens up, with vertex at (2, 1), focus at (2, 3), and directrix y = −1. The graph of this parabola
appears as follows.

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

The axis of symmetry of a vertical (opening up or down) parabola is a vertical line passing through the vertex. The
parabola has an interesting reflective property. Suppose we have a satellite dish with a parabolic cross section. If a beam of
electromagnetic waves, such as light or radio waves, comes into the dish in a straight line from a satellite (parallel to the
axis of symmetry), then the waves reflect off the dish and collect at the focus of the parabola as shown.

Consider a parabolic dish designed to collect signals from a satellite in space. The dish is aimed directly at the satellite, and
a receiver is located at the focus of the parabola. Radio waves coming in from the satellite are reflected off the surface of the
parabola to the receiver, which collects and decodes the digital signals. This allows a small receiver to gather signals from a
wide angle of sky. Flashlights and headlights in a car work on the same principle, but in reverse: the source of the light (that
is, the light bulb) is located at the focus and the reflecting surface on the parabolic mirror focuses the beam straight ahead.
This allows a small light bulb to illuminate a wide angle of space in front of the flashlight or car.

Ellipses
An ellipse can also be defined in terms of distances. In the case of an ellipse, there are two foci (plural of focus), and two
directrices (plural of directrix). We look at the directrices in more detail later in this section.

Definition
An ellipse is the set of all points for which the sum of their distances from two fixed points (the foci) is constant.

Figure 1.48 A typical ellipse in which the sum of the distances from any
point on the ellipse to the foci is constant.

A graph of a typical ellipse is shown in Figure 1.48. In this figure the foci are labeled as F and F′. Both are the same
fixed distance from the origin, and this distance is represented by the variable c. Therefore the coordinates of F are (c, 0)
and the coordinates of F′ are (−c, 0). The points P and P′ are located at the ends of the major axis of the ellipse, and
have coordinates (a, 0) and (−a, 0), respectively. The major axis is always the longest distance across the ellipse, and
can be horizontal or vertical. Thus, the length of the major axis in this ellipse is 2a. Furthermore, P and P′ are called the
vertices of the ellipse. The points Q and Q′ are located at the ends of the minor axis of the ellipse, and have coordinates

(0, b) and (0, −b), respectively. The minor axis is the shortest distance across the ellipse. The minor axis is perpendicular
to the major axis.
According to the definition of the ellipse, we can choose any point on the ellipse and the sum of the distances from this
point to the two foci is constant. Suppose we choose the point P. Since the coordinates of point P are (a, 0), the sum of
the distances is

d(P, F) + d(P, F′) = (a − c) + (a + c) = 2a.
Therefore the sum of the distances from an arbitrary point A with coordinates (x, y) is also equal to 2a. Using the distance
formula, we get

d(A, F) + d(A, F′) = 2a
(x − c) 2 + y 2 + (x + c) 2 + y 2 = 2a.
Subtract the second radical from both sides and square both sides:

(x − c) 2 + y 2 = 2a − (x + c) 2 + y 2
(x − c) 2 + y 2 = 4a 2 − 4a (x + c) 2 + y 2 + (x + c) 2 + y 2
x 2 − 2cx + c 2 + y 2 = 4a 2 − 4a (x + c) 2 + y 2 + x 2 + 2cx + c 2 + y 2
−2cx = 4a 2 − 4a (x + c) 2 + y 2 + 2cx.
Now isolate the radical on the right-hand side and square again:

80

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

−2cx = 4a 2 − 4a (x + c) 2 + y 2 + 2cx
4a (x + c) 2 + y 2 = 4a 2 + 4cx

If we refer back to Figure 1.48, then the length of each of the two green line segments is equal to a. This is true because
the sum of the distances from the point Q to the foci F and F′ is equal to 2a, and the lengths of these two line segments
are equal. This line segment forms a right triangle with hypotenuse length a and leg lengths b and c. From the Pythagorean
theorem, a 2 + b 2 = c 2 and b 2 = a 2 − c 2. Therefore the equation of the ellipse becomes

x 2 + y = 1.

Finally, if the center of the ellipse is moved from the origin to a point (h, k), we have the following standard form of an
ellipse.

Theorem 1.9: Equation of an Ellipse in Standard Form
Consider the ellipse with center (h, k), a horizontal major axis with length 2a, and a vertical minor axis with length
2b. Then the equation of this ellipse in standard form is

and the foci are located at (h ± c, k), where c 2 = a 2 − b 2. The equations of the directrices are x = h ± ac .

and the foci are located at (h, k ± c),

If the major axis is horizontal, then the ellipse is called horizontal, and if the major axis is vertical, then the ellipse is

and B are either both positive or both negative. To convert the equation from general to standard form, use the method of
completing the square.

Similarly, we are adding 36 to the second set as well. Therefore the equation becomes

9⎛⎝x 2 − 4x + 4⎞⎠ + 4⎛⎝y 2 + 6y + 9⎞⎠ = −36 + 36 + 36

9⎛⎝x 2 − 4x + 4⎞⎠ + 4⎛⎝y 2 + 6y + 9⎞⎠ = 36.

Put the equation 9x 2 + 16y 2 + 18x − 64y − 71 = 0 into standard form and graph the resulting ellipse.

According to Kepler’s first law of planetary motion, the orbit of a planet around the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun at one
of the foci as shown in Figure 1.50(a). Because Earth’s orbit is an ellipse, the distance from the Sun varies throughout the
year. A commonly held misconception is that Earth is closer to the Sun in the summer. In fact, in summer for the northern
hemisphere, Earth is farther from the Sun than during winter. The difference in season is caused by the tilt of Earth’s axis
in the orbital plane. Comets that orbit the Sun, such as Halley’s Comet, also have elliptical orbits, as do moons orbiting the
planets and satellites orbiting Earth.
Ellipses also have interesting reflective properties: A light ray emanating from one focus passes through the other focus
after mirror reflection in the ellipse. The same thing occurs with a sound wave as well. The National Statuary Hall in the
U.S. Capitol in Washington, DC, is a famous room in an elliptical shape as shown in Figure 1.50(b). This hall served as
the meeting place for the U.S. House of Representatives for almost fifty years. The location of the two foci of this semielliptical room are clearly identified by marks on the floor, and even if the room is full of visitors, when two people stand on
these spots and speak to each other, they can hear each other much more clearly than they can hear someone standing close
by. Legend has it that John Quincy Adams had his desk located on one of the foci and was able to eavesdrop on everyone
else in the House without ever needing to stand. Although this makes a good story, it is unlikely to be true, because the
original ceiling produced so many echoes that the entire room had to be hung with carpets to dampen the noise. The ceiling
was rebuilt in 1902 and only then did the now-famous whispering effect emerge. Another famous whispering gallery—the
site of many marriage proposals—is in Grand Central Station in New York City.

Hyperbolas
A hyperbola can also be defined in terms of distances. In the case of a hyperbola, there are two foci and two directrices.
Hyperbolas also have two asymptotes.

Definition
A hyperbola is the set of all points where the difference between their distances from two fixed points (the foci) is
constant.
A graph of a typical hyperbola appears as follows.

Figure 1.51 A typical hyperbola in which the difference of the distances from any
point on the ellipse to the foci is constant. The transverse axis is also called the major
axis, and the conjugate axis is also called the minor axis.

The derivation of the equation of a hyperbola in standard form is virtually identical to that of an ellipse. One slight hitch lies
in the definition: The difference between two numbers is always positive. Let P be a point on the hyperbola with coordinates
(x, y). Then the definition of the hyperbola gives d⎛⎝P, F 1⎞⎠ − d⎛⎝P, F 2⎞⎠ = constant. To simplify the derivation, assume

|

|

that P is on the right branch of the hyperbola, so the absolute value bars drop. If it is on the left branch, then the subtraction
is reversed. The vertex of the right branch has coordinates (a, 0), so

d⎛⎝P, F 1⎞⎠ − d⎛⎝P, F 2⎞⎠ = (c + a) − (c − a) = 2a.
This equation is therefore true for any point on the hyperbola. Returning to the coordinates (x, y) for P:

d⎛⎝P, F 1⎞⎠ − d⎛⎝P, F 2⎞⎠ = 2a
(x + c) 2 + y 2 − (x − c) 2 + y 2 = 2a.
Add the second radical from both sides and square both sides:

(x − c) 2 + y 2 = 2a + (x + c) 2 + y 2
(x − c) 2 + y 2 = 4a 2 + 4a (x + c) 2 + y 2 + (x + c) 2 + y 2
x 2 − 2cx + c 2 + y 2 = 4a 2 + 4a (x + c) 2 + y 2 + x 2 + 2cx + c 2 + y 2
−2cx = 4a 2 + 4a (x + c) 2 + y 2 + 2cx.
Now isolate the radical on the right-hand side and square again:

84

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

−2cx = 4a 2 + 4a (x + c) 2 + y 2 + 2cx
4a (x + c) 2 + y 2 = −4a 2 − 4cx

We now define b so that b 2 = c 2 − a 2. This is possible because c > a. Therefore the equation of the ellipse becomes
2
x 2 − y = 1.

Finally, if the center of the hyperbola is moved from the origin to the point (h, k), we have the following standard form of
a hyperbola.

Theorem 1.10: Equation of a Hyperbola in Standard Form

If the major axis (transverse axis) is horizontal, then the hyperbola is called horizontal, and if the major axis is vertical
then the hyperbola is called vertical. The equation of a hyperbola is in general form if it is in the form
Ax 2 + By 2 + Cx + Dy + E = 0, where A and B have opposite signs. In order to convert the equation from general to
standard form, use the method of completing the square.

Example 1.21
Finding the Standard Form of a Hyperbola
Put the equation 9x 2 − 16y 2 + 36x + 32y − 124 = 0 into standard form and graph the resulting hyperbola.
What are the equations of the asymptotes?

Solution
First add 124 to both sides of the equation:

9x 2 − 16y 2 + 36x + 32y = 124.
Next group the x terms together and the y terms together, then factor out the common factors:
⎛ 2

⎝9x + 36x⎠ − ⎝16y − 32y⎠

= 124.

We need to determine the constant that, when added inside each set of parentheses, results in a perfect square. In
⎛ ⎞

2

the first set of parentheses, take half the coefficient of x and square it. This gives ⎝4 ⎠ = 4. In the second set
⎛

⎞

2

of parentheses, take half the coefficient of y and square it. This gives ⎝−2 ⎠ = 1. Add these inside each pair of

2

parentheses. Since the first set of parentheses has a 9 in front, we are actually adding 36 to the left-hand side.
Similarly, we are subtracting 16 from the second set of parentheses. Therefore the equation becomes

9⎛⎝x 2 + 4x + 4⎞⎠ − 16⎛⎝y 2 − 2y + 1⎞⎠ = 124 + 36 − 16

9⎛⎝x 2 + 4x + 4⎞⎠ − 16⎛⎝y 2 − 2y + 1⎞⎠ = 144.
Next factor both sets of parentheses and divide by 144:

9(x + 2) 2 − 16⎛⎝y − 1⎞⎠ 2 = 144
9(x + 2) 2 16⎛⎝y − 1⎞⎠ 2

The equation is now in standard form. Comparing this to Equation 1.15 gives h = −2,

k = 1,

a = 4,

and b = 3. This is a horizontal hyperbola with center at (−2, 1) and asymptotes given by the equations

y = 1 ± 3 (x + 2). The graph of this hyperbola appears in the following figure.

Put the equation 4y 2 − 9x 2 + 16y + 18x − 29 = 0 into standard form and graph the resulting

Hyperbolas also have interesting reflective properties. A ray directed toward one focus of a hyperbola is reflected by a
hyperbolic mirror toward the other focus. This concept is illustrated in the following figure.

Figure 1.53 A hyperbolic mirror used to collect light from distant stars.

This property of the hyperbola has important applications. It is used in radio direction finding (since the difference in signals
from two towers is constant along hyperbolas), and in the construction of mirrors inside telescopes (to reflect light coming
from the parabolic mirror to the eyepiece). Another interesting fact about hyperbolas is that for a comet entering the solar
system, if the speed is great enough to escape the Sun’s gravitational pull, then the path that the comet takes as it passes
through the solar system is hyperbolic.

Eccentricity and Directrix
An alternative way to describe a conic section involves the directrices, the foci, and a new property called eccentricity. We

Chapter 1 | Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates

87

will see that the value of the eccentricity of a conic section can uniquely define that conic.

Definition
The eccentricity e of a conic section is defined to be the distance from any point on the conic section to its focus,
divided by the perpendicular distance from that point to the nearest directrix. This value is constant for any conic
section, and can define the conic section as well:
1. If e = 1, the conic is a parabola.
2. If e < 1, it is an ellipse.
3. If e > 1, it is a hyperbola.
The eccentricity of a circle is zero. The directrix of a conic section is the line that, together with the point known
as the focus, serves to define a conic section. Hyperbolas and noncircular ellipses have two foci and two associated
directrices. Parabolas have one focus and one directrix.
The three conic sections with their directrices appear in the following figure.

Figure 1.54 The three conic sections with their foci and directrices.

Recall from the definition of a parabola that the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus is equal to the distance
from that same point to the directrix. Therefore, by definition, the eccentricity of a parabola must be 1. The equations of the
2

directrices of a horizontal ellipse are x = ± ac . The right vertex of the ellipse is located at (a, 0) and the right focus is

(c, 0). Therefore the distance from the vertex to the focus is a − c and the distance from the vertex to the right directrix
2

is ac − c. This gives the eccentricity as

c(a − c) c(a − c) c
e = a2 − c = 2
=
= a.
a −a
a − ac a(a − c)
c
Since c < a, this step proves that the eccentricity of an ellipse is less than 1. The directrices of a horizontal hyperbola are
2

also located at x = ± ac , and a similar calculation shows that the eccentricity of a hyperbola is also e = ac . However in
this case we have c > a, so the eccentricity of a hyperbola is greater than 1.

eccentricity of the ellipse is e = ac = 3 = 0.6.

Polar Equations of Conic Sections
Sometimes it is useful to write or identify the equation of a conic section in polar form. To do this, we need the concept of
the focal parameter. The focal parameter of a conic section p is defined as the distance from a focus to the nearest directrix.
The following table gives the focal parameters for the different types of conics, where a is the length of the semi-major axis
(i.e., half the length of the major axis), c is the distance from the origin to the focus, and e is the eccentricity. In the case of
a parabola, a represents the distance from the vertex to the focus.

Table 1.1 Eccentricities and Focal Parameters of the
Conic Sections
Using the definitions of the focal parameter and eccentricity of the conic section, we can derive an equation for any conic
section in polar coordinates. In particular, we assume that one of the foci of a given conic section lies at the pole. Then using
the definition of the various conic sections in terms of distances, it is possible to prove the following theorem.

In the equation on the left, the major axis of the conic section is horizontal, and in the equation on the right, the major axis
is vertical. To work with a conic section written in polar form, first make the constant term in the denominator equal to 1.
This can be done by dividing both the numerator and the denominator of the fraction by the constant that appears in front of
the plus or minus in the denominator. Then the coefficient of the sine or cosine in the denominator is the eccentricity. This
value identifies the conic. If cosine appears in the denominator, then the conic is horizontal. If sine appears, then the conic
is vertical. If both appear then the axes are rotated. The center of the conic is not necessarily at the origin. The center is at
the origin only if the conic is a circle (i.e., e = 0).

Example 1.23
Graphing a Conic Section in Polar Coordinates

Solution
The constant term in the denominator is 1, so the eccentricity of the conic is 2. This is a hyperbola. The focal
parameter p can be calculated by using the equation ep = 3. Since e = 2, this gives p = 3 . The cosine

function appears in the denominator, so the hyperbola is horizontal. Pick a few values for θ and create a table of
values. Then we can graph the hyperbola (Figure 1.55).

General Equations of Degree Two
A general equation of degree two can be written in the form

Ax 2 + Bxy + Cy 2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0.
The graph of an equation of this form is a conic section. If B ≠ 0 then the coordinate axes are rotated. To identify the conic
section, we use the discriminant of the conic section 4AC − B 2. One of the following cases must be true:
1.

4AC − B 2 > 0. If so, the graph is an ellipse.

2.

4AC − B 2 = 0. If so, the graph is a parabola.

3.

4AC − B 2 < 0. If so, the graph is a hyperbola.

The simplest example of a second-degree equation involving a cross term is xy = 1. This equation can be solved for y to
obtain y = 1x . The graph of this function is called a rectangular hyperbola as shown.

Modern astronomical observatories often consist of a large number of parabolic reflectors, connected by computers, used

in multidimensional space. Many of the computations are similar to those in the study of single-variable functions, but there
are also a lot of differences. In this first chapter, we examine coordinate systems for working in three-dimensional space,
along with vectors, which are a key mathematical tool for dealing with quantities in more than one dimension. Let’s start
here with the basic ideas and work our way up to the more general and powerful tools of mathematics in later chapters.

2.1 | Vectors in the Plane
Learning Objectives
2.1.1 Describe a plane vector, using correct notation.
2.1.2 Perform basic vector operations (scalar multiplication, addition, subtraction).
2.1.3 Express a vector in component form.
2.1.4 Explain the formula for the magnitude of a vector.
2.1.5 Express a vector in terms of unit vectors.
2.1.6 Give two examples of vector quantities.
When describing the movement of an airplane in flight, it is important to communicate two pieces of information: the
direction in which the plane is traveling and the plane’s speed. When measuring a force, such as the thrust of the plane’s
engines, it is important to describe not only the strength of that force, but also the direction in which it is applied. Some
quantities, such as or force, are defined in terms of both size (also called magnitude) and direction. A quantity that has
magnitude and direction is called a vector. In this text, we denote vectors by boldface letters, such as v.

Definition
A vector is a quantity that has both magnitude and direction.

Vector Representation
A vector in a plane is represented by a directed line segment (an arrow). The endpoints of the segment are called the initial
point and the terminal point of the vector. An arrow from the initial point to the terminal point indicates the direction of
the vector. The length of the line segment represents its magnitude. We use the notation ‖ v ‖ to denote the magnitude of
the vector v. A vector with an initial point and terminal point that are the same is called the zero vector, denoted 0. The
zero vector is the only vector without a direction, and by convention can be considered to have any direction convenient to
the problem at hand.
Vectors with the same magnitude and direction are called equivalent vectors. We treat equivalent vectors as equal, even if
they have different initial points. Thus, if v and w are equivalent, we write

v = w.
Definition
Vectors are said to be equivalent vectors if they have the same magnitude and direction.
The arrows in Figure 2.2(b) are equivalent. Each arrow has the same length and direction. A closely related concept is the
idea of parallel vectors. Two vectors are said to be parallel if they have the same or opposite directions. We explore this idea
in more detail later in the chapter. A vector is defined by its magnitude and direction, regardless of where its initial point is
located.

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

103

Figure 2.2 (a) A vector is represented by a directed line segment from its initial
point to its terminal point. (b) Vectors v 1 through v 5 are equivalent.

The use of boldface, lowercase letters to name vectors is a common representation in print, but there are alternative
notations. When writing the name of a vector by hand, for example, it is easier to sketch an arrow over the variable than to

→
simulate boldface type: →
v . When a vector has initial point P and terminal point Q, the notation PQ is useful because
it indicates the direction and location of the vector.

Example 2.1
Sketching Vectors
Sketch a vector in the plane from initial point P(1, 1) to terminal point Q(8, 5).

Solution
→

See Figure 2.3. Because the vector goes from point P to point Q, we name it PQ .

Figure 2.3 The vector with initial point (1, 1) and terminal

→

point (8, 5) is named PQ .

2.1

→
Sketch the vector ST where S is point (3, −1) and T is point (−2, 3).

Combining Vectors
Vectors have many real-life applications, including situations involving force or velocity. For example, consider the forces

104

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

acting on a boat crossing a river. The boat’s motor generates a force in one direction, and the current of the river generates a
force in another direction. Both forces are vectors. We must take both the magnitude and direction of each force into account
if we want to know where the boat will go.
A second example that involves vectors is a quarterback throwing a football. The quarterback does not throw the ball
parallel to the ground; instead, he aims up into the air. The velocity of his throw can be represented by a vector. If we know
how hard he throws the ball (magnitude—in this case, speed), and the angle (direction), we can tell how far the ball will
travel down the field.
A real number is often called a scalar in mathematics and physics. Unlike vectors, scalars are generally considered to have
a magnitude only, but no direction. Multiplying a vector by a scalar changes the vector’s magnitude. This is called scalar
multiplication. Note that changing the magnitude of a vector does not indicate a change in its direction. For example, wind
blowing from north to south might increase or decrease in speed while maintaining its direction from north to south.

Definition
The product kv of a vector v and a scalar k is a vector with a magnitude that is |k| times the magnitude of v, and
with a direction that is the same as the direction of v if k > 0, and opposite the direction of v if k < 0. This is

called scalar multiplication. If k = 0 or v = 0, then kv = 0.
As you might expect, if k = −1, we denote the product kv as

kv = (−1)v = −v.
Note that −v has the same magnitude as v, but has the opposite direction (Figure 2.4).

Figure 2.4 (a) The original vector v has length n units. (b)
The length of 2v equals 2n units. (c) The length of v/2 is
n/2 units. (d) The vectors v and −v have the same length but
opposite directions.

Another operation we can perform on vectors is to add them together in vector addition, but because each vector may have
its own direction, the process is different from adding two numbers. The most common graphical method for adding two
vectors is to place the initial point of the second vector at the terminal point of the first, as in Figure 2.5(a). To see why this
makes sense, suppose, for example, that both vectors represent displacement. If an object moves first from the initial point
to the terminal point of vector v, then from the initial point to the terminal point of vector w, the overall displacement
is the same as if the object had made just one movement from the initial point to the terminal point of the vector v + w.
For obvious reasons, this approach is called the triangle method. Notice that if we had switched the order, so that w was
our first vector and v was our second vector, we would have ended up in the same place. (Again, see Figure 2.5(a).) Thus,

v + w = w + v.

A second method for adding vectors is called the parallelogram method. With this method, we place the two vectors so
they have the same initial point, and then we draw a parallelogram with the vectors as two adjacent sides, as in Figure
2.5(b). The length of the diagonal of the parallelogram is the sum. Comparing Figure 2.5(b) and Figure 2.5(a), we can
see that we get the same answer using either method. The vector v + w is called the vector sum.

Definition
The sum of two vectors v and w can be constructed graphically by placing the initial point of w at the terminal point

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

105

of v. Then, the vector sum, v + w, is the vector with an initial point that coincides with the initial point of v and
has a terminal point that coincides with the terminal point of w. This operation is known as vector addition.

Figure 2.5 (a) When adding vectors by the triangle method,
the initial point of w is the terminal point of v. (b) When
adding vectors by the parallelogram method, the vectors v and
w have the same initial point.

It is also appropriate here to discuss vector subtraction. We define v − w as v + (−w) = v + (−1)w. The vector v − w
is called the vector difference. Graphically, the vector v − w is depicted by drawing a vector from the terminal point of
w to the terminal point of v (Figure 2.6).

Figure 2.6 (a) The vector difference v − w is depicted by
drawing a vector from the terminal point of w to the terminal
point of v. (b) The vector v − w is equivalent to the vector

v + (−w).

In Figure 2.5(a), the initial point of v + w is the initial point of v. The terminal point of v + w is the terminal point of
w. These three vectors form the sides of a triangle. It follows that the length of any one side is less than the sum of the
lengths of the remaining sides. So we have

‖v+w‖ ≤ ‖v‖ + ‖w‖.
This is known more generally as the triangle inequality. There is one case, however, when the resultant vector u + v has
the same magnitude as the sum of the magnitudes of u and v. This happens only when u and v have the same direction.

Vector Components
Working with vectors in a plane is easier when we are working in a coordinate system. When the initial points and terminal
points of vectors are given in Cartesian coordinates, computations become straightforward.

Example 2.3
Comparing Vectors
Are v and w equivalent vectors?
a.

v has initial point (3, 2) and terminal point (7, 2)

w has initial point (1, −4) and terminal point (1, 0)
b.

v has initial point (0, 0) and terminal point (1, 1)

w has initial point (−2, 2) and terminal point (−1, 3)
Solution
a. The vectors are each 4 units long, but they are oriented in different directions. So v and w are not
equivalent (Figure 2.10).

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Figure 2.10 These vectors are not equivalent.

b. Based on Figure 2.11, and using a bit of geometry, it is clear these vectors have the same length and the
same direction, so v and w are equivalent.

2.3

Which of the following vectors are equivalent?

We have seen how to plot a vector when we are given an initial point and a terminal point. However, because a vector can

be placed anywhere in a plane, it may be easier to perform calculations with a vector when its initial point coincides with
the origin. We call a vector with its initial point at the origin a standard-position vector. Because the initial point of any
vector in standard position is known to be (0, 0), we can describe the vector by looking at the coordinates of its terminal
point. Thus, if vector v has its initial point at the origin and its terminal point at (x, y), we write the vector in component
form as

v = 〈 x, y 〉 .
When a vector is written in component form like this, the scalars x and y are called the components of v.

Definition
The vector with initial point (0, 0) and terminal point (x, y) can be written in component form as

v = 〈 x, y 〉 .
The scalars x and y are called the components of v.
Recall that vectors are named with lowercase letters in bold type or by drawing an arrow over their name. We have also
learned that we can name a vector by its component form, with the coordinates of its terminal point in angle brackets.
However, when writing the component form of a vector, it is important to distinguish between 〈 x, y 〉 and (x, y). The
first ordered pair uses angle brackets to describe a vector, whereas the second uses parentheses to describe a point in a plane.
The initial point of 〈 x, y 〉 is (0, 0); the terminal point of 〈 x, y 〉 is (x, y).
When we have a vector not already in standard position, we can determine its component form in one of two ways. We can
use a geometric approach, in which we sketch the vector in the coordinate plane, and then sketch an equivalent standardposition vector. Alternatively, we can find it algebraically, using the coordinates of the initial point and the terminal point.
To find it algebraically, we subtract the x-coordinate of the initial point from the x-coordinate of the terminal point to get
the x component, and we subtract the y-coordinate of the initial point from the y-coordinate of the terminal point to get the
y component.

Rule: Component Form of a Vector
Let v be a vector with initial point (x i, y i) and terminal point (x t, y t). Then we can express v in component form as

v = 〈 x t − x i, y t − y i 〉 .

Example 2.4
Expressing Vectors in Component Form
Express vector v with initial point (−3, 4) and terminal point (1, 2) in component form.

Solution
a. Geometric
1. Sketch the vector in the coordinate plane (Figure 2.12).
2. The terminal point is 4 units to the right and 2 units down from the initial point.
3. Find the point that is 4 units to the right and 2 units down from the origin.
4. In standard position, this vector has initial point (0, 0) and terminal point (4, −2):

110

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

v = 〈 4, −2 〉 .

Figure 2.12 These vectors are equivalent.

b. Algebraic
In the first solution, we used a sketch of the vector to see that the terminal point lies 4 units to the right.
We can accomplish this algebraically by finding the difference of the x-coordinates:

x t − x i = 1 − (−3) = 4.
Similarly, the difference of the y-coordinates shows the vertical length of the vector.

y t − y i = 2 − 4 = −2.
So, in component form,

v = 〈 x t − x i, y t − y i 〉
= 〈 1 − (−3), 2 − 4 〉
= 〈 4, −2 〉 .

2.4

Vector w has initial point (−4, −5) and terminal point (−1, 2). Express w in component form.

To find the magnitude of a vector, we calculate the distance between its initial point and its terminal point. The magnitude
of vector v = 〈 x, y 〉 is denoted ‖ v ‖ , or |v|, and can be computed using the formula

‖ v ‖ = x 2 + y 2.
Note that because this vector is written in component form, it is equivalent to a vector in standard position, with its initial
point at the origin and terminal point (x, y). Thus, it suffices to calculate the magnitude of the vector in standard position.
Using the distance formula to calculate the distance between initial point (0, 0) and terminal point (x, y), we have

‖v‖

= (x − 0) 2 + ⎛⎝y − 0⎞⎠ 2
= x 2 + y 2.

Based on this formula, it is clear that for any vector v,

‖ v ‖ ≥ 0, and ‖ v ‖ = 0 if and only if v = 0.

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

111

The magnitude of a vector can also be derived using the Pythagorean theorem, as in the following figure.

Figure 2.13 If you use the components of a vector to define a
right triangle, the magnitude of the vector is the length of the
triangle’s hypotenuse.

We have defined scalar multiplication and vector addition geometrically. Expressing vectors in component form allows us
to perform these same operations algebraically.

Definition
Let v = 〈 x 1, y 1 〉 and w = 〈 x 2, y 2 〉 be vectors, and let k be a scalar.
Scalar multiplication: kv = 〈 kx 1, ky 1 〉
Vector addition: v + w = 〈 x 1, y 1 〉 + 〈 x 2, y 2 〉 = 〈 x 1 + x 2, y 1 + y 2 〉

Example 2.5
Performing Operations in Component Form
Let v be the vector with initial point (2, 5) and terminal point (8, 13), and let w = 〈 −2, 4 〉 .
a. Express v in component form and find ‖ v ‖ . Then, using algebra, find
b.

v + w,

c.

3v, and

d.

v − 2w.

Solution
a. To place the initial point of v at the origin, we must translate the vector 2 units to the left and
5 units down (Figure 2.15). Using the algebraic method, we can express v as

v = 〈 8 − 2, 13 − 5 〉 = 〈 6, 8 〉 :

‖ v ‖ = 6 2 + 8 2 = 36 + 64 = 100 = 10.

112

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Figure 2.14 In component form, v = 〈 6, 8 〉 .

b. To find v + w, add the x-components and the y-components separately:

v + w = 〈 6, 8 〉 + 〈 −2, 4 〉 = 〈 4, 12 〉 .
c. To find 3v, multiply v by the scalar k = 3:

3v = 3 · 〈 6, 8 〉 = 〈 3 · 6, 3 · 8 〉 = 〈 18, 24 〉 .
d. To find v − 2w, find −2w and add it to v:

v − 2w = 〈 6, 8 〉 − 2 · 〈 −2, 4 〉 = 〈 6, 8 〉 + 〈 4, −8 〉 = 〈 10, 0 〉 .

Now that we have established the basic rules of vector arithmetic, we can state the properties of vector operations. We will

Proof of Commutative Property
Let u = 〈 x 1, y 1 〉 and v = 〈 x 2, y 2 〉 . Apply the commutative property for real numbers:

u + v = 〈 x 1 + x 2, y 1 + y 2 〉 = 〈 x 2 + x 1, y 2 + y 1 〉 = v + u.

2.6

Prove the additive inverse property.

We have found the components of a vector given its initial and terminal points. In some cases, we may only have the
magnitude and direction of a vector, not the points. For these vectors, we can identify the horizontal and vertical components
using trigonometry (Figure 2.15).

Figure 2.15 The components of a vector form the legs of a
right triangle, with the vector as the hypotenuse.

Consider the angle θ formed by the vector v and the positive x-axis. We can see from the triangle that the components
of vector v are 〈 ‖ v ‖ cos θ, ‖ v ‖ sin θ 〉 . Therefore, given an angle and the magnitude of a vector, we can use the
cosine and sine of the angle to find the components of the vector.

Example 2.6
Finding the Component Form of a Vector Using Trigonometry
Find the component form of a vector with magnitude 4 that forms an angle of −45° with the x-axis.

Solution
Let x and y represent the components of the vector (Figure 2.16). Then x = 4 cos(−45°) = 2 2 and

y = 4 sin(−45°) = −2 2. The component form of the vector is 〈 2 2, −2 2 〉 .

Figure 2.16 Use trigonometric ratios, x = ‖ v ‖ cos θ and

y = ‖ v ‖ sin θ, to identify the components of the vector.

2.7 Find the component form of vector v with magnitude 10 that forms an angle of 120° with the positive
x-axis.

Unit Vectors
A unit vector is a vector with magnitude 1. For any nonzero vector v, we can use scalar multiplication to find a unit
vector u that has the same direction as v. To do this, we multiply the vector by the reciprocal of its magnitude:

u=

1 v.
‖v‖

Recall that when we defined scalar multiplication, we noted that ‖ kv ‖ = |k| · ‖ v ‖ . For u =

‖u‖ =

1 v, it follows that
‖v‖

1 ⎛⎝ ‖ v ‖ ⎞⎠ = 1. We say that u is the unit vector in the direction of v (Figure 2.17). The process of using
‖v‖

scalar multiplication to find a unit vector with a given direction is called normalization.

a. First, find the magnitude of v, then divide the components of v by the magnitude:

‖ v ‖ = 12 + 22 = 1 + 4 = 5

b. The vector u is in the same direction as v and ‖ u ‖ = 1. Use scalar multiplication to increase the

5 5

2.8

Let v = 〈 9, 2 〉 . Find a vector with magnitude 5 in the opposite direction as v.

We have seen how convenient it can be to write a vector in component form. Sometimes, though, it is more convenient to
write a vector as a sum of a horizontal vector and a vertical vector. To make this easier, let’s look at standard unit vectors.
The standard unit vectors are the vectors i = 〈 1, 0 〉 and j = 〈 0, 1 〉 (Figure 2.18).

Figure 2.18 The standard unit vectors i and j.

By applying the properties of vectors, it is possible to express any vector in terms of i and j in what we call a linear
combination:

v = 〈 x, y 〉 = 〈 x, 0 〉 + 〈 0, y 〉 = x 〈 1, 0 〉 + y 〈 0, 1 〉 = xi + yj.
Thus, v is the sum of a horizontal vector with magnitude x, and a vertical vector with magnitude y, as in the following
figure.

Figure 2.19 The vector v is the sum of xi and yj.

Example 2.8

b. Vector u is a unit vector that forms an angle of 60° with the positive x-axis. Use standard unit vectors
to describe u.

Solution
a. Resolve vector w into a vector with a zero y-component and a vector with a zero x-component:

w = 〈 3, −4 〉 = 3i − 4j.
b. Because u is a unit vector, the terminal point lies on the unit circle when the vector is placed in standard
position (Figure 2.20).

Because vectors have both direction and magnitude, they are valuable tools for solving problems involving such
applications as motion and force. Recall the boat example and the quarterback example we described earlier. Here we look
at two other examples in detail.

Finding Resultant Force
Jane’s car is stuck in the mud. Lisa and Jed come along in a truck to help pull her out. They attach one end of a tow
strap to the front of the car and the other end to the truck’s trailer hitch, and the truck starts to pull. Meanwhile,
Jane and Jed get behind the car and push. The truck generates a horizontal force of 300 lb on the car. Jane and Jed
are pushing at a slight upward angle and generate a force of 150 lb on the car. These forces can be represented by
vectors, as shown in Figure 2.21. The angle between these vectors is 15°. Find the resultant force (the vector
sum) and give its magnitude to the nearest tenth of a pound and its direction angle from the positive x-axis.

Figure 2.21 Two forces acting on a car in different directions.

Solution
To find the effect of combining the two forces, add their representative vectors. First, express each vector in
component form or in terms of the standard unit vectors. For this purpose, it is easiest if we align one of the
vectors with the positive x-axis. The horizontal vector, then, has initial point (0, 0) and terminal point (300, 0).
It can be expressed as 〈 300, 0 〉 or 300i.
The second vector has magnitude 150 and makes an angle of 15° with the first, so we can express it as
〈 150 cos(15°), 150 sin(15°) 〉 , or 150 cos(15°)i + 150 sin(15°)j. Then, the sum of the vectors, or resultant
vector, is r = 〈 300, 0 〉 + 〈 150 cos(15°), 150 sin(15°) 〉 , and we have

‖r‖
The angle

made by

r and the positive x-axis has tan θ =

150 sin 15°
≈ 0.09,
(300 + 150 cos 15°)

so

θ ≈ tan −1 (0.09) ≈ 5°, which means the resultant force r has an angle of 5° above the horizontal axis.

Example 2.10
Finding Resultant Velocity
An airplane flies due west at an airspeed of 425 mph. The wind is blowing from the northeast at 40 mph. What
is the ground speed of the airplane? What is the bearing of the airplane?

Solution
Let’s start by sketching the situation described (Figure 2.22).

118

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Figure 2.22 Initially, the plane travels due west. The wind is
from the northeast, so it is blowing to the southwest. The angle
between the plane’s course and the wind is 45°. (Figure not
drawn to scale.)

Set up a sketch so that the initial points of the vectors lie at the origin. Then, the plane’s velocity vector is
p = −425i. The vector describing the wind makes an angle of 225° with the positive x-axis:

w = 〈 40 cos(225°), 40 sin(225°) 〉 = 〈 − 40 , − 40 〉 = − 40 i − 40 j.
2
2
2
2
When the airspeed and the wind act together on the plane, we can add their vectors to find the resultant force:

⎛
⎞ ⎛
⎞
p + w = −425i + ⎝− 40 i − 40 j⎠ = ⎝−425 − 40 ⎠i − 40 j.

2

2

The magnitude of the resultant vector shows the effect of the wind on the ground speed of the airplane:

⎛
⎛
‖ p + w ‖ = ⎝−425 − 40 ⎠ + ⎝− 40 ⎠ ≈ 454.17 mph

2

As a result of the wind, the plane is traveling at approximately 454 mph relative to the ground.
To determine the bearing of the airplane, we want to find the direction of the vector p + w:

tan θ =

⎛

⎝−425 − 2 ⎠

≈ 0.06

θ ≈ 3.57°.
The overall direction of the plane is 3.57° south of west.

2.2.5 Perform vector operations in ℝ 3 .
Vectors are useful tools for solving two-dimensional problems. Life, however, happens in three dimensions. To expand the
use of vectors to more realistic applications, it is necessary to create a framework for describing three-dimensional space.
For example, although a two-dimensional map is a useful tool for navigating from one place to another, in some cases the
topography of the land is important. Does your planned route go through the mountains? Do you have to cross a river?
To appreciate fully the impact of these geographic features, you must use three dimensions. This section presents a natural
extension of the two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate plane into three dimensions.

Three-Dimensional Coordinate Systems
As we have learned, the two-dimensional rectangular coordinate system contains two perpendicular axes: the horizontal
x-axis and the vertical y-axis. We can add a third dimension, the z-axis, which is perpendicular to both the x-axis and
the y-axis. We call this system the three-dimensional rectangular coordinate system. It represents the three dimensions we
encounter in real life.

Definition
The three-dimensional rectangular coordinate system consists of three perpendicular axes: the x-axis, the y-axis,
and the z-axis. Because each axis is a number line representing all real numbers in ℝ , the three-dimensional system
is often denoted by ℝ 3 .
In Figure 2.23(a), the positive z-axis is shown above the plane containing the x- and y-axes. The positive x-axis appears to
the left and the positive y-axis is to the right. A natural question to ask is: How was arrangement determined? The system
displayed follows the right-hand rule. If we take our right hand and align the fingers with the positive x-axis, then curl
the fingers so they point in the direction of the positive y-axis, our thumb points in the direction of the positive z-axis. In
this text, we always work with coordinate systems set up in accordance with the right-hand rule. Some systems do follow a
left-hand rule, but the right-hand rule is considered the standard representation.

124

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Figure 2.23 (a) We can extend the two-dimensional rectangular coordinate system by
adding a third axis, the z-axis, that is perpendicular to both the x-axis and the y-axis. (b) The
right-hand rule is used to determine the placement of the coordinate axes in the standard
Cartesian plane.

In two dimensions, we describe a point in the plane with the coordinates (x, y). Each coordinate describes how the point
aligns with the corresponding axis. In three dimensions, a new coordinate, z, is appended to indicate alignment with the
z-axis: (x, y, z). A point in space is identified by all three coordinates (Figure 2.24). To plot the point (x, y, z), go x
units along the x-axis, then y units in the direction of the y-axis, then z units in the direction of the z-axis.

Figure 2.24 To plot the point (x, y, z) go x units along the
x-axis, then y units in the direction of the y-axis, then z units
in the direction of the z-axis.

Example 2.11
Locating Points in Space
Sketch the point (1, −2, 3) in three-dimensional space.

Solution
To sketch a point, start by sketching three sides of a rectangular prism along the coordinate axes: one unit in the
positive x direction, 2 units in the negative y direction, and 3 units in the positive z direction. Complete the
prism to plot the point (Figure 2.25).

In two-dimensional space, the coordinate plane is defined by a pair of perpendicular axes. These axes allow us to
name any location within the plane. In three dimensions, we define coordinate planes by the coordinate axes, just as
in two dimensions. There are three axes now, so there are three intersecting pairs of axes. Each pair of axes forms a
coordinate plane: the xy-plane, the xz-plane, and the yz-plane (Figure 2.26). We define the xy-plane formally as the
following set: ⎛⎝x, y, 0⎞⎠ : x, y ∈ ℝ . Similarly, the xz-plane and the yz-plane are defined as {(x, 0, z) : x, z ∈ ℝ } and

To visualize this, imagine you’re building a house and are standing in a room with only two of the four walls finished.
(Assume the two finished walls are adjacent to each other.) If you stand with your back to the corner where the two finished
walls meet, facing out into the room, the floor is the xy-plane, the wall to your right is the xz-plane, and the wall to your left
is the yz-plane.

Figure 2.26 The plane containing the x- and y-axes is called
the xy-plane. The plane containing the x- and z-axes is called the
xz-plane, and the y- and z-axes define the yz-plane.

In two dimensions, the coordinate axes partition the plane into four quadrants. Similarly, the coordinate planes divide space
between them into eight regions about the origin, called octants. The octants fill ℝ 3 in the same way that quadrants fill

126

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

ℝ 2 , as shown in Figure 2.27.

Figure 2.27 Points that lie in octants have three nonzero
coordinates.

Most work in three-dimensional space is a comfortable extension of the corresponding concepts in two dimensions. In
this section, we use our knowledge of circles to describe spheres, then we expand our understanding of vectors to three
dimensions. To accomplish these goals, we begin by adapting the distance formula to three-dimensional space.
If two points lie in the same coordinate plane, then it is straightforward to calculate the distance between them. We that the
distance d between two points (x 1, y 1) and (x 2, y 2) in the xy-coordinate plane is given by the formula

d = (x 2 − x 1) 2 + (y 2 − y 1) 2.
The formula for the distance between two points in space is a natural extension of this formula.

Theorem 2.2: The Distance between Two Points in Space
The distance d between points (x 1, y 1, z 1) and (x 2, y 2, z 2) is given by the formula

d = (x 2 − x 1) 2 + (y 2 − y 1) 2 + (z 2 − z 1) 2.

(2.1)

The proof of this theorem is left as an exercise. (Hint: First find the distance d 1 between the points (x 1, y 1, z 1) and

(x 2, y 2, z 1) as shown in Figure 2.28.)

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Before moving on to the next section, let’s get a feel for how ℝ 3 differs from ℝ 2 . For example, in ℝ 2 , lines that
are not parallel must always intersect. This is not the case in ℝ 3 . For example, consider the line shown in Figure 2.30.
These two lines are not parallel, nor do they intersect.

Figure 2.30 These two lines are not parallel, but still do not
intersect.

You can also have circles that are interconnected but have no points in common, as in Figure 2.31.

Figure 2.31 These circles are interconnected, but have no
points in common.

We have a lot more flexibility working in three dimensions than we do if we stuck with only two dimensions.

129

Writing Equations in ℝ3
Now that we can represent points in space and find the distance between them, we can learn how to write equations of
geometric objects such as lines, planes, and curved surfaces in ℝ 3 . First, we start with a simple equation. Compare the
graphs of the equation x = 0 in ℝ , ℝ 2 , and ℝ 3 (Figure 2.32). From these graphs, we can see the same equation
can describe a point, a line, or a plane.

Figure 2.32 (a) In ℝ , the equation x = 0 describes a single point. (b) In ℝ 2 , the equation x = 0 describes a line, the
y-axis. (c) In ℝ 3 , the equation x = 0 describes a plane, the yz-plane.

In space, the equation x = 0 describes all points ⎛⎝0, y, z⎞⎠. This equation defines the yz-plane. Similarly, the xy-plane

contains all points of the form ⎛⎝x, y, 0⎞⎠. The equation z = 0 defines the xy-plane and the equation y = 0 describes the
xz-plane (Figure 2.33).

Figure 2.33 (a) In space, the equation z = 0 describes the xy-plane. (b) All points in the

xz-plane satisfy the equation y = 0.

Understanding the equations of the coordinate planes allows us to write an equation for any plane that is parallel to one of
the coordinate planes. When a plane is parallel to the xy-plane, for example, the z-coordinate of each point in the plane has
the same constant value. Only the x- and y-coordinates of points in that plane vary from point to point.

130

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Rule: Equations of Planes Parallel to Coordinate Planes
1. The plane in space that is parallel to the xy-plane and contains point (a, b, c) can be represented by the
equation z = c.
2. The plane in space that is parallel to the xz-plane and contains point (a, b, c) can be represented by the
equation y = b.
3. The plane in space that is parallel to the yz-plane and contains point (a, b, c) can be represented by the
equation x = a.

Example 2.13
Writing Equations of Planes Parallel to Coordinate Planes
a. Write an equation of the plane passing through point (3, 11, 7) that is parallel to the yz-plane.
b. Find an equation of the plane passing through points (6, −2, 9),

(0, −2, 4), and (1, −2, −3).

Solution
a. When a plane is parallel to the yz-plane, only the y- and z-coordinates may vary. The x-coordinate has the
same constant value for all points in this plane, so this plane can be represented by the equation x = 3.
b. Each of the points (6, −2, 9),

(0, −2, 4), and (1, −2, −3) has the same y-coordinate. This plane

can be represented by the equation y = −2.

2.13

Write an equation of the plane passing through point (1, −6, −4) that is parallel to the xy-plane.

As we have seen, in ℝ 2 the equation x = 5 describes the vertical line passing through point (5, 0). This line is parallel
to the y-axis. In a natural extension, the equation x = 5 in ℝ 3 describes the plane passing through point (5, 0, 0),
which is parallel to the yz-plane. Another natural extension of a familiar equation is found in the equation of a sphere.

Definition
A sphere is the set of all points in space equidistant from a fixed point, the center of the sphere (Figure 2.34), just
as the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from the center represents a circle. In a sphere, as in a circle, the
distance from the center to a point on the sphere is called the radius.

Figure 2.34 Each point (x, y, z) on the surface of a sphere is

r units away from the center (a, b, c).

The equation of a circle is derived using the distance formula in two dimensions. In the same way, the equation of a sphere
is based on the three-dimensional formula for distance.

Rule: Equation of a Sphere
The sphere with center (a, b, c) and radius r can be represented by the equation

(x − a) 2 + ⎛⎝y − b⎞⎠ 2 + (z − c) 2 = r 2.
This equation is known as the standard equation of a sphere.

Working with Vectors in ℝ3
Just like two-dimensional vectors, three-dimensional vectors are quantities with both magnitude and direction, and they are
represented by directed line segments (arrows). With a three-dimensional vector, we use a three-dimensional arrow.
Three-dimensional vectors can also be represented in component form. The notation v = 〈 x, y, z 〉 is a natural extension
of the two-dimensional case, representing a vector with the initial point at the origin, (0, 0, 0), and terminal point

(x, y, z). The zero vector is 0 = 〈 0, 0, 0 〉 . So, for example, the three dimensional vector v = 〈 2, 4, 1 〉 is
represented by a directed line segment from point (0, 0, 0) to point (2, 4, 1) (Figure 2.39).

136

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Figure 2.39 Vector v = 〈 2, 4, 1 〉 is represented by a
directed line segment from point (0, 0, 0) to point (2, 4, 1).

Vector addition and scalar multiplication are defined analogously to the two-dimensional case. If v = 〈 x 1, y 1, z 1 〉 and

w = 〈 x 2, y 2, z 2 〉 are vectors, and k is a scalar, then

v + w = 〈 x 1 + x 2, y 1 + y 2, z 1 + z 2 〉 and kv = 〈 kx 1, ky 1, kz 1 〉 .
If k = −1, then kv = (−1)v is written as −v, and vector subtraction is defined by v − w = v + (−w) = v + (−1)w.
The standard unit vectors extend easily into three dimensions as well— i = 〈 1, 0, 0 〉 ,

j = 〈 0, 1, 0 〉 ,

and

k = 〈 0, 0, 1 〉 —and we use them in the same way we used the standard unit vectors in two dimensions. Thus, we can
represent a vector in ℝ 3 in the following ways:

v = 〈 x, y, z 〉 = xi + yj + zk.

As described earlier, vectors in three dimensions behave in the same way as vectors in a plane. The geometric interpretation
of vector addition, for example, is the same in both two- and three-dimensional space (Figure 2.41).

Figure 2.41 To add vectors in three dimensions, we follow
the same procedures we learned for two dimensions.

We have already seen how some of the algebraic properties of vectors, such as vector addition and scalar multiplication,
can be extended to three dimensions. Other properties can be extended in similar fashion. They are summarized here for our

We have seen that vector addition in two dimensions satisfies the commutative, associative, and additive inverse properties.
These properties of vector operations are valid for three-dimensional vectors as well. Scalar multiplication of vectors
satisfies the distributive property, and the zero vector acts as an additive identity. The proofs to verify these properties in
three dimensions are straightforward extensions of the proofs in two dimensions.

w = 〈 1, −1, 0 〉 .

Solution
a. First, use scalar multiplication of each vector, then subtract:

3v − 2w = 3 〈 −2, 9, 5 〉 − 2 〈 1, −1, 0 〉
= 〈 −6, 27, 15 〉 − 〈 2, −2, 0 〉
= 〈 −6 − 2, 27 − (−2), 15 − 0 〉
= 〈 −8, 29, 15 〉 .
b. Write the equation for the magnitude of the vector, then use scalar multiplication:

5 ‖ w ‖ = 5 1 2 + (−1) 2 + 0 2 = 5 2.
c. First, use scalar multiplication, then find the magnitude of the new vector. Note that the result is the same
as for part b.:

‖ 5w ‖ = ‖ 〈 5, −5, 0 〉 ‖ = 5 2 + (−5) 2 + 0 2 = 50 = 5 2.
d. Recall that to find a unit vector in two dimensions, we divide a vector by its magnitude. The procedure is
the same in three dimensions:

Example 2.20
Throwing a Forward Pass
A quarterback is standing on the football field preparing to throw a pass. His receiver is standing 20 yd down
the field and 15 yd to the quarterback’s left. The quarterback throws the ball at a velocity of 60 mph toward the
receiver at an upward angle of 30° (see the following figure). Write the initial velocity vector of the ball, v, in
component form.

Solution
The first thing we want to do is find a vector in the same direction as the velocity vector of the ball. We then
scale the vector appropriately so that it has the right magnitude. Consider the vector w extending from the
quarterback’s arm to a point directly above the receiver’s head at an angle of 30° (see the following figure). This
vector would have the same direction as v, but it may not have the right magnitude.

The receiver is 20 yd down the field and 15 yd to the quarterback’s left. Therefore, the straight-line distance from
the quarterback to the receiver is

Dist from QB to receiver = 15 2 + 20 2 = 225 + 400 = 625 = 25 yd.
We have

25 = cos 30°. Then the magnitude of w is given by
‖w‖
‖w‖ =

25 = 25 · 2 = 50 yd
cos 30°
3
3

and the vertical distance from the receiver to the terminal point of w is

Vert dist from receiver to terminal point of w = ‖ w ‖ sin 30° = 50 · 1 = 25 yd.
3 2

141

Then w = 〈 20, 15, 25 〉 , and has the same direction as v.

3

Recall, though, that we calculated the magnitude of w to be ‖ w ‖ = 50 , and v has magnitude 60 mph.

3

So, we need to multiply vector w by an appropriate constant, k. We want to find a value of k so that
‖ kw ‖ = 60 mph. We have

‖ kw ‖ = k ‖ w ‖ = k 50 mph,
3
so we want

k 50 = 60
3
k = 60 3
50
k = 6 3.
5
Then

v = kw = k 〈 20, 15, 25 〉 = 6 3 〈 20, 15, 25 〉 = 〈 24 3, 18 3, 30 〉 .
5
3
3
Let’s double-check that ‖ v ‖ = 60. We have

‖v‖ =

24 3⎞⎠ 2 + ⎛⎝18 3⎞⎠ 2 + (30) 2 = 1728 + 972 + 900 = 3600 = 60 mph.

⎛
⎝

So, we have found the correct components for v.

2.20 Assume the quarterback and the receiver are in the same place as in the previous example. This time,
however, the quarterback throws the ball at velocity of 40 mph and an angle of 45°. Write the initial velocity
vector of the ball, v, in component form.

2.3 | The Dot Product
Learning Objectives
2.3.1 Calculate the dot product of two given vectors.
2.3.2 Determine whether two given vectors are perpendicular.
2.3.3 Find the direction cosines of a given vector.
2.3.4 Explain what is meant by the vector projection of one vector onto another vector, and
describe how to compute it.
2.3.5 Calculate the work done by a given force.
If we apply a force to an object so that the object moves, we say that work is done by the force. In Introduction to
Applications of Integration (http://cnx.org/content/m53638/latest/) on integration applications, we looked at a
constant force and we assumed the force was applied in the direction of motion of the object. Under those conditions, work
can be expressed as the product of the force acting on an object and the distance the object moves. In this chapter, however,
we have seen that both force and the motion of an object can be represented by vectors.
In this section, we develop an operation called the dot product, which allows us to calculate work in the case when the force
vector and the motion vector have different directions. The dot product essentially tells us how much of the force vector is
applied in the direction of the motion vector. The dot product can also help us measure the angle formed by a pair of vectors
and the position of a vector relative to the coordinate axes. It even provides a simple test to determine whether two vectors
meet at a right angle.

The Dot Product and Its Properties
We have already learned how to add and subtract vectors. In this chapter, we investigate two types of vector multiplication.
The first type of vector multiplication is called the dot product, based on the notation we use for it, and it is defined as
follows:

Definition
The dot product of vectors u = 〈 u 1, u 2, u 3 〉 and v = 〈 v 1, v 2, v 3 〉 is given by the sum of the products of the
components

u · v = u 1 v 1 + u 2 v 2 + u 3 v 3.

(2.3)

Note that if u and v are two-dimensional vectors, we calculate the dot product in a similar fashion. Thus, if u = 〈 u 1, u 2 〉
and v = 〈 v 1, v 2 〉 , then

u · v = u 1 v 1 + u 2 v 2.
When two vectors are combined under addition or subtraction, the result is a vector. When two vectors are combined using
the dot product, the result is a scalar. For this reason, the dot product is often called the scalar product. It may also be called
the inner product.

Example 2.21
Calculating Dot Products
a. Find the dot product of u = 〈 3, 5, 2 〉 and v = 〈 −1, 3, 0 〉 .
b. Find the scalar product of p = 10i − 4j + 7k and q = −2i + j + 6k.

Solution

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

147

a. Substitute the vector components into the formula for the dot product:

u · v = u1 v1 + u2 v2 + u3 v3
= 3(−1) + 5(3) + 2(0) = −3 + 15 + 0 = 12.
b. The calculation is the same if the vectors are written using standard unit vectors. We still have three
components for each vector to substitute into the formula for the dot product:

p · q = u1 v1 + u2 v2 + u3 v3
= 10(−2) + (−4)(1) + (7)(6) = −20 − 4 + 42 = 18.

2.21

Find u · v, where u = 〈 2, 9, −1 〉 and v = 〈 −3, 1, −4 〉 .

Like vector addition and subtraction, the dot product has several algebraic properties. We prove three of these properties
and leave the rest as exercises.

Let u,

v, and w be vectors, and let c be a scalar.

‖v‖2

Commutative property
Distributive property
Associative property
Property of magnitude

Proof
Let u = 〈 u 1, u 2, u 3 〉 and v = 〈 v 1, v 2, v 3 〉 . Then

u · v = 〈 u 1, u 2, u 3 〉 · 〈 v 1, v 2, v 3 〉
= u1 v1 + u2 v2 + u3 v3
= v1 u1 + v2 u2 + v3 u3
= 〈 v 1, v 2, v 3 〉 · 〈 u 1, u 2, u 3 〉
= v · u.
The associative property looks like the associative property for real-number multiplication, but pay close attention to the
difference between scalar and vector objects:

c(u · v) = c(u 1 v 1 + u 2 v 2 + u 3 v 3)

= c(u 1 v 1) + c(u 2 v 2) + c(u 3 v 3)
= (cu 1)v 1 + (cu 2)v 2 + (cu 3)v 3
= 〈 cu 1, cu 2, cu 3 〉 · 〈 v 1, v 2, v 3 〉
= c 〈 u 1, u 2, u 3 〉 · 〈 v 1, v 2, v 3 〉
= (cu) · v.

The proof that c(u · v) = u · (cv) is similar.
The fourth property shows the relationship between the magnitude of a vector and its dot product with itself:

Note that the definition of the dot product yields 0 · v = 0. By property iv., if v · v = 0, then v = 0.

Using the Dot Product to Find the Angle between Two Vectors
When two nonzero vectors are placed in standard position, whether in two dimensions or three dimensions, they form an
angle between them (Figure 2.44). The dot product provides a way to find the measure of this angle. This property is a
result of the fact that we can express the dot product in terms of the cosine of the angle formed by two vectors.

Figure 2.44 Let θ be the angle between two nonzero vectors u
and v such that 0 ≤ θ ≤ π.

Theorem 2.4: Evaluating a Dot Product
The dot product of two vectors is the product of the magnitude of each vector and the cosine of the angle between
them:

u · v = ‖ u ‖ ‖ v ‖ cos θ.

(2.4)

Proof
Place vectors u and v in standard position and consider the vector v − u (Figure 2.45). These three vectors form a triangle
with side lengths ‖ u ‖ , ‖ v ‖ , and ‖ v − u ‖ .

Figure 2.45 The lengths of the sides of the triangle are given
by the magnitudes of the vectors that form the triangle.

Recall from trigonometry that the law of cosines describes the relationship among the side lengths of the triangle and the
angle θ. Applying the law of cosines here gives

‖ v − u ‖ 2 = ‖ u ‖ 2 + ‖ v ‖ 2 − 2 ‖ u ‖ ‖ v ‖ cos θ.
The dot product provides a way to rewrite the left side of this equation:

‖ v − u ‖ 2 = (v − u) · (v − u)
= (v − u) · v − (v − u) · u
= v·v − u·v − v·u + u·u
= v·v − u·v − u·v + u·u
= ‖ v ‖ 2 − 2u · v + ‖ u ‖ 2.
Substituting into the law of cosines yields

‖v−u‖ 2 =

‖ u ‖ 2 + ‖ v ‖ 2 − 2 ‖ u ‖ ‖ v ‖ cos θ

‖ v ‖ 2 − 2u · v + ‖ u ‖ 2 = ‖ u ‖ 2 + ‖ v ‖ 2 − 2 ‖ u ‖ ‖ v ‖ cos θ
−2u · v = −2 ‖ u ‖ ‖ v ‖ cos θ
u·v =

‖ u ‖ ‖ v ‖ cos θ.

□
We can use this form of the dot product to find the measure of the angle between two nonzero vectors. The following
equation rearranges Equation 2.3 to solve for the cosine of the angle:

cos θ =

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Using this equation, we can find the cosine of the angle between two nonzero vectors. Since we are considering the smallest
angle between the vectors, we assume 0° ≤ θ ≤ 180° (or 0 ≤ θ ≤ π if we are working in radians). The inverse cosine is
unique over this range, so we are then able to determine the measure of the angle θ.

Example 2.23
Finding the Angle between Two Vectors

b.

〈 2, 5, 6 〉 and 〈 −2, −4, 4 〉

Solution
a. To find the cosine of the angle formed by the two vectors, substitute the components of the vectors into
Equation 2.5:

cos θ =
=

(i + j + k) · ⎛⎝2i − j − 3k⎞⎠
‖ i + j + k ‖ · ‖ 2i − j − 3k ‖

Therefore, θ = arccos −2 rad.

b. Start by finding the value of the cosine of the angle between the vectors:

cos θ =

Now, cos θ = 0 and 0 ≤ θ ≤ π, so θ = π/2.

Find the measure of the angle, in radians, formed by vectors a = 〈 1, 2, 0 〉 and b = 〈 2, 4, 1 〉 .

Round to the nearest hundredth.
The angle between two vectors can be acute (0 < cos θ < 1), obtuse (−1 < cos θ < 0), or straight (cos θ = −1). If

cos θ = 1, then both vectors have the same direction. If cos θ = 0, then the vectors, when placed in standard position,
form a right angle (Figure 2.46). We can formalize this result into a theorem regarding orthogonal (perpendicular) vectors.

Figure 2.46 (a) An acute angle has 0 < cos θ < 1. (b) An obtuse angle has
−1 < cos θ < 0. (c) A straight line has cos θ = −1. (d) If the vectors have the same
direction, cos θ = 1. (e) If the vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular), cos θ = 0.

Theorem 2.5: Orthogonal Vectors
The nonzero vectors u and v are orthogonal vectors if and only if u · v = 0.

Proof
Let u and v be nonzero vectors, and let θ denote the angle between them. First, assume u · v = 0. Then

‖ u ‖ ‖ v ‖ cos θ = 0.
However, ‖ u ‖ ≠ 0 and ‖ v ‖ ≠ 0, so we must have cos θ = 0. Hence, θ = 90°, and the vectors are orthogonal.
Now assume u and v are orthogonal. Then θ = 90° and we have

u · v = ‖ u ‖ ‖ v ‖ cos θ = ‖ u ‖ ‖ v ‖ cos 90° = ‖ u ‖ ‖ v ‖ (0) = 0.
□
The terms orthogonal, perpendicular, and normal each indicate that mathematical objects are intersecting at right angles.
The use of each term is determined mainly by its context. We say that vectors are orthogonal and lines are perpendicular.
The term normal is used most often when measuring the angle made with a plane or other surface.

Solution
Using the definition, we need only check the dot product of the vectors:

p · q = 1(10) + (0)(3) + (5)(−2) = 10 + 0 − 10 = 0.
Because p · q = 0, the vectors are orthogonal (Figure 2.47).

initial points are aligned.

The angle a vector makes with each of the coordinate axes, called a direction angle, is very important in practical
computations, especially in a field such as engineering. For example, in astronautical engineering, the angle at which a
rocket is launched must be determined very precisely. A very small error in the angle can lead to the rocket going hundreds
of miles off course. Direction angles are often calculated by using the dot product and the cosines of the angles, called the
direction cosines. Therefore, we define both these angles and their cosines.

Definition
The angles formed by a nonzero vector and the coordinate axes are called the direction angles for the vector (Figure
2.48). The cosines for these angles are called the direction cosines.

So far, we have focused mainly on vectors related to force, movement, and position in three-dimensional physical space.
However, vectors are often used in more abstract ways. For example, suppose a fruit vendor sells apples, bananas,
and oranges. On a given day, he sells 30 apples, 12 bananas, and 18 oranges. He might use a quantity vector,
q = 〈 30, 12, 18 〉 , to represent the quantity of fruit he sold that day. Similarly, he might want to use a price vector,

p = 〈 0.50, 0.25, 1 〉 , to indicate that he sells his apples for 50¢ each, bananas for 25¢ each, and oranges for $1 apiece.
In this example, although we could still graph these vectors, we do not interpret them as literal representations of position
in the physical world. We are simply using vectors to keep track of particular pieces of information about apples, bananas,
and oranges.
This idea might seem a little strange, but if we simply regard vectors as a way to order and store data, we find they can be
quite a powerful tool. Going back to the fruit vendor, let’s think about the dot product, q · p. We compute it by multiplying
the number of apples sold (30) by the price per apple (50¢), the number of bananas sold by the price per banana, and the
number of oranges sold by the price per orange. We then add all these values together. So, in this example, the dot product
tells us how much money the fruit vendor had in sales on that particular day.
When we use vectors in this more general way, there is no reason to limit the number of components to three. What if
the fruit vendor decides to start selling grapefruit? In that case, he would want to use four-dimensional quantity and price
vectors to represent the number of apples, bananas, oranges, and grapefruit sold, and their unit prices. As you might expect,
to calculate the dot product of four-dimensional vectors, we simply add the products of the components as before, but the
sum has four terms instead of three.

Example 2.26
Using Vectors in an Economic Context
AAA Party Supply Store sells invitations, party favors, decorations, and food service items such as paper plates
and napkins. When AAA buys its inventory, it pays 25¢ per package for invitations and party favors. Decorations
cost AAA 50¢ each, and food service items cost 20¢ per package. AAA sells invitations for $2.50 per package and
party favors for $1.50 per package. Decorations sell for $4.50 each and food service items for $1.25 per package.
During the month of May, AAA Party Supply Store sells 1258 invitations, 342 party favors, 2426 decorations,
and 1354 food service items. Use vectors and dot products to calculate how much money AAA made in sales
during the month of May. How much did the store make in profit?

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

155

Solution
The cost, price, and quantity vectors are

c = 〈 0.25, 0.25, 0.50, 0.20 〉
p = 〈 2.50, 1.50, 4.50, 1.25 〉
q = 〈 1258, 342, 2426, 1354 〉 .
AAA sales for the month of May can be calculated using the dot product p · q. We have

p · q = 〈 2.50, 1.50, 4.50, 1.25 〉 · 〈 1258, 342, 2426, 1354 〉
= 3145 + 513 + 10917 + 1692.5
= 16267.5.
So, AAA took in $16,267.50 during the month of May.
To calculate the profit, we must first calculate how much AAA paid for the items sold. We use the dot product
c · q to get

c · q = 〈 0.25, 0.25, 0.50, 0.20 〉 · 〈 1258, 342, 2426, 1354 〉
= 314.5 + 85.5 + 1213 + 270.8
= 1883.8.
So, AAA paid $1,883.30 for the items they sold. Their profit, then, is given by

p · q − c · q = 16267.5 − 1883.8
= 14383.7.
Therefore, AAA Party Supply Store made $14,383.70 in May.

2.26 On June 1, AAA Party Supply Store decided to increase the price they charge for party favors to $2 per
package. They also changed suppliers for their invitations, and are now able to purchase invitations for only
10¢ per package. All their other costs and prices remain the same. If AAA sells 1408 invitations, 147 party
favors, 2112 decorations, and 1894 food service items in the month of June, use vectors and dot products to
calculate their total sales and profit for June.

Projections
As we have seen, addition combines two vectors to create a resultant vector. But what if we are given a vector and we need
to find its component parts? We use vector projections to perform the opposite process; they can break down a vector into
its components. The magnitude of a vector projection is a scalar projection. For example, if a child is pulling the handle of
a wagon at a 55° angle, we can use projections to determine how much of the force on the handle is actually moving the
wagon forward (Figure 2.49). We return to this example and learn how to solve it after we see how to calculate projections.

Figure 2.49 When a child pulls a wagon, only the horizontal
component of the force propels the wagon forward.

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Definition
The vector projection of v onto u is the vector labeled projuv in Figure 2.50. It has the same initial point as u and v
and the same direction as u, and represents the component of v that acts in the direction of u. If θ represents the angle
between u and v, then, by properties of triangles, we know the length of proj u v is ‖ proj u v ‖ = ‖ v ‖ cos θ.
When expressing cos θ in terms of the dot product, this becomes

‖ proj u v ‖

= ‖ v ‖ cos θ

⎛

proj u v = u · v ⎝ 1 u⎠ = u · v 2 u.

The length of this vector is also known as the scalar projection of v onto u and is denoted by

‖ proj u v ‖ = comp u v = u · v .

of vector v in the direction of u.

Sometimes it is useful to decompose vectors—that is, to break a vector apart into a sum. This process is called the resolution
of a vector into components. Projections allow us to identify two orthogonal vectors having a desired sum. For example, let
v = 〈 6, −4 〉 and let u = 〈 3, 1 〉 . We want to decompose the vector v into orthogonal components such that one of
the component vectors has the same direction as u.
We first find the component that has the same direction as u by projecting v onto u. Let p = proj u v. Then, we have

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Work
Now that we understand dot products, we can see how to apply them to real-life situations. The most common application
of the dot product of two vectors is in the calculation of work.
From physics, we know that work is done when an object is moved by a force. When the force is constant and applied in the
same direction the object moves, then we define the work done as the product of the force and the distance the object travels:
W = Fd. We saw several examples of this type in earlier chapters. Now imagine the direction of the force is different from
the direction of motion, as with the example of a child pulling a wagon. To find the work done, we need to multiply the
component of the force that acts in the direction of the motion by the magnitude of the displacement. The dot product allows
us to do just that. If we represent an applied force by a vector F and the displacement of an object by a vector s, then the
work done by the force is the dot product of F and s.

Definition
When a constant force is applied to an object so the object moves in a straight line from point P to point Q, the work
W done by the force F, acting at an angle θ from the line of motion, is given by

→
→
W = F · PQ = ‖ F ‖ ‖ PQ ‖ cos θ.

(2.8)

Let’s revisit the problem of the child’s wagon introduced earlier. Suppose a child is pulling a wagon with a force having
a magnitude of 8 lb on the handle at an angle of 55°. If the child pulls the wagon 50 ft, find the work done by the force
(Figure 2.51).

Figure 2.51 The horizontal component of the force is the
projection of F onto the positive x-axis.

We have

→
W = ‖ F ‖ ‖ PQ ‖ cos θ = 8(50)⎛⎝cos(55°)⎞⎠ ≈ 229 ft · lb.
In U.S. standard units, we measure the magnitude of force ‖ F ‖ in pounds. The magnitude of the displacement vector

→
‖ PQ ‖ tells us how far the object moved, and it is measured in feet. The customary unit of measure for work, then, is

the foot-pound. One foot-pound is the amount of work required to move an object weighing 1 lb a distance of 1 ft straight
up. In the metric system, the unit of measure for force is the newton (N), and the unit of measure of magnitude for work is
a newton-meter (N·m), or a joule (J).

Example 2.30
Calculating Work
A conveyor belt generates a force F = 5i − 3j + k that moves a suitcase from point (1, 1, 1) to point (9, 4, 7)
along a straight line. Find the work done by the conveyor belt. The distance is measured in meters and the force
is measured in newtons.

2.4 | The Cross Product
Learning Objectives
2.4.1 Calculate the cross product of two given vectors.
2.4.2 Use determinants to calculate a cross product.
2.4.3 Find a vector orthogonal to two given vectors.
2.4.4 Determine areas and volumes by using the cross product.
2.4.5 Calculate the torque of a given force and position vector.
Imagine a mechanic turning a wrench to tighten a bolt. The mechanic applies a force at the end of the wrench. This creates
rotation, or torque, which tightens the bolt. We can use vectors to represent the force applied by the mechanic, and the
distance (radius) from the bolt to the end of the wrench. Then, we can represent torque by a vector oriented along the axis
of rotation. Note that the torque vector is orthogonal to both the force vector and the radius vector.
In this section, we develop an operation called the cross product, which allows us to find a vector orthogonal to two given
vectors. Calculating torque is an important application of cross products, and we examine torque in more detail later in the
section.

The Cross Product and Its Properties
The dot product is a multiplication of two vectors that results in a scalar. In this section, we introduce a product of
two vectors that generates a third vector orthogonal to the first two. Consider how we might find such a vector. Let
u = 〈 u 1, u 2, u 3 〉 and v = 〈 v 1, v 2, v 3 〉 be nonzero vectors. We want to find a vector w = 〈 w 1, w 2, w 3 〉
orthogonal to both u and v —that is, we want to find w such that u · w = 0 and v · w = 0. Therefore, w 1,

w 3 must satisfy

w 2, and

u1 w1 + u2 w2 + u3 w3 = 0

v 1 w 1 + v 2 w 2 + v 3 w 3 = 0.

If we multiply the top equation by v 3 and the bottom equation by u 3 and subtract, we can eliminate the variable w 3,
which gives

(u 1 v 3 − v 1 u 3)w 1 + (u 2 v 3 − v 2 u 3)w 2 = 0.
If we select

w1 = u2 v3 − u3 v2
w 2 = −(u 1 v 3 − u 3 v 1),
we get a possible solution vector. Substituting these values back into the original equations gives

w 3 = u 1 v 2 − u 2 v 1.
That is, vector

w = 〈 u 2 v 3 − u 3 v 2, −(u 1 v 3 − u 3 v 1), u 1 v 2 − u 2 v 1 〉
is orthogonal to both u and v, which leads us to define the following operation, called the cross product.

Definition
Let u = 〈 u 1, u 2, u 3 〉 and v = 〈 v 1, v 2, v 3 〉 . Then, the cross product u × v is vector

u × v = (u 2 v 3 − u 3 v 2)i − (u 1 v 3 − u 3 v 1)j + (u 1 v 2 − u 2 v 1)k
= 〈 u 2 v 3 − u 3 v 2, −(u 1 v 3 − u 3 v 1), u 1 v 2 − u 2 v 1 〉 .

(2.9)

From the way we have developed u × v, it should be clear that the cross product is orthogonal to both u and v. However,

166

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

it never hurts to check. To show that u × v is orthogonal to u, we calculate the dot product of u and u × v.

u · (u × v) = 〈 u 1, u 2, u 3 〉 · 〈 u 2 v 3 − u 3 v 2, −u 1 v 3 + u 3 v 1, u 1 v 2 − u 2 v 1 〉

= u 1 (u 2 v 3 − u 3 v 2) + u 2 (−u 1 v 3 + u 3 v 1) + u 3 (u 1 v 2 − u 2 v 1)
= u1 u2 v3 − u1 u3 v2 − u1 u2 v3 + u2 u3 v1 + u1 u3 v2 − u2 u3 v1
= (u 1 u 2 v 3 − u 1 u 2 v 3) + (−u 1 u 3 v 2 + u 1 u 3 v 2) + (u 2 u 3 v 1 − u 2 u 3 v 1)
=0

In a similar manner, we can show that the cross product is also orthogonal to v.

Example 2.31
Finding a Cross Product
Let p = 〈 −1, 2, 5 〉 and q = 〈 4, 0, −3 〉 (Figure 2.53). Find p × q.

Figure 2.53 Finding a cross product to two given vectors.

Solution
Substitute the components of the vectors into Equation 2.9:

p × q = 〈 −1, 2, 5 〉 × 〈 4, 0, −3 〉
= 〈 p 2 q 3 − p 3 q 2, p 1 q 3 − p 3 q 1, p 1 q 2 − p 2 q 1 〉
= 〈 2(−3) − 5(0), −(−1)(−3) + 5(4), (−1)(0) − 2(4) 〉
= 〈 −6, 17, −8 〉 .

2.30

Find p × q for p = 〈 5, 1, 2 〉 and q = 〈 −2, 0, 1 〉 . Express the answer using standard unit

vectors.
Although it may not be obvious from Equation 2.9, the direction of u × v is given by the right-hand rule. If we hold the
right hand out with the fingers pointing in the direction of u, then curl the fingers toward vector v, the thumb points in

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

167

the direction of the cross product, as shown.

Figure 2.54 The direction of u × v is determined by the right-hand rule.

Notice what this means for the direction of v × u. If we apply the right-hand rule to v × u, we start with our fingers
pointed in the direction of v, then curl our fingers toward the vector u. In this case, the thumb points in the opposite
direction of u × v. (Try it!)

Example 2.32
Anticommutativity of the Cross Product
Let u = 〈 0, 2, 1 〉 and v = 〈 3, −1, 0 〉 . Calculate u × v and v × u and graph them.

Figure 2.55 Are the cross products u × v and v × u in the same
direction?

168

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Solution
We have

u×v =
v×u =

〈 (0 + 1), −(0 − 3), (0 − 6) 〉 = 〈 1, 3, −6 〉
〈 (−1 − 0), −(3 − 0), (6 − 0) 〉 = 〈 −1, −3, 6 〉 .

We see that, in this case, u × v = −(v × u) (Figure 2.56). We prove this in general later in this section.

Figure 2.56 The cross products u × v and v × u are both
orthogonal to u and v, but in opposite directions.

2.31 Suppose vectors u and v lie in the xy-plane (the z-component of each vector is zero). Now suppose the
x- and y-components of u and the y-component of v are all positive, whereas the x-component of v is
negative. Assuming the coordinate axes are oriented in the usual positions, in which direction does u × v
point?
The cross products of the standard unit vectors i, j, and k can be useful for simplifying some calculations, so let’s
consider these cross products. A straightforward application of the definition shows that

i × i = j × j = k × k = 0.
(The cross product of two vectors is a vector, so each of these products results in the zero vector, not the scalar 0.) It’s up
to you to verify the calculations on your own.
Furthermore, because the cross product of two vectors is orthogonal to each of these vectors, we know that the cross product

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11966/1.2

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

169

of i and j is parallel to k. Similarly, the vector product of i and k is parallel to j, and the vector product of j and k
is parallel to i. We can use the right-hand rule to determine the direction of each product. Then we have

i× j = k
j×k = i
k×i = j

j × i = −k
k × j = −i
i × k = −j.

These formulas come in handy later.

Example 2.33

Find i × ⎛⎝ j × k⎞⎠.

Solution
We know that j × k = i. Therefore, i × ⎛⎝ j × k⎞⎠ = i × i = 0.

2.32

Find ⎛⎝i × j⎞⎠ × (k × i).

As we have seen, the dot product is often called the scalar product because it results in a scalar. The cross product results in
a vector, so it is sometimes called the vector product. These operations are both versions of vector multiplication, but they
have very different properties and applications. Let’s explore some properties of the cross product. We prove only a few of
them. Proofs of the other properties are left as exercises.

Proof
For property i., we want to show u × v = −(v × u). We have

u × v = 〈 u 1, u 2, u 3 〉 × 〈 v 1, v 2, v 3 〉
= 〈 u 2 v 3 − u 3 v 2, −u 1 v 3 + u 3 v 1, u 1 v 2 − u 2 v 1 〉
= − 〈 u 3 v 2 − u 2 v 3, −u 3 v 1 + u 1 v 3, u 2 v 1 − u 1 v 2 〉
= − 〈 v 1, v 2, v 3 〉 × 〈 u 1, u 2, u 3 〉
= −(v × u).
Unlike most operations we’ve seen, the cross product is not commutative. This makes sense if we think about the right-hand
rule.
For property iv., this follows directly from the definition of the cross product. We have

170

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

u × 0 = 〈 u 2 (0) − u 3 (0), −⎛⎝u 2 (0) − u 3 (0)⎞⎠, u 1 (0) − u 2 (0) 〉
= 〈 0, 0, 0 〉 = 0.
Then, by property i., 0 × u = 0 as well. Remember that the dot product of a vector and the zero vector is the scalar 0,
whereas the cross product of a vector with the zero vector is the vector 0.

Property vi. looks like the associative property, but note the change in operations:

u · (v × w) = u · 〈 v 2 w 3 − v 3 w 2, −v 1 w 3 + v 3 w 1, v 1 w 2 − v 2 w 1 〉

= u 1 (v 2 w 3 − v 3 w 2) + u 2 (−v 1 w 3 + v 3 w 1) + u 3 (v 1 w 2 − v 2 w 1)
= u1 v2 w3 − u1 v3 w2 − u2 v1 w3 + u2 v3 w1 + u3 v1 w2 − u3 v2 w1
= (u 2 v 3 − u 3 v 2)w 1 + (u 3 v 1 − u 1 v 3)w 2 + (u 1 v 2 − u 2 v 1)w 3
= 〈 u 2 v 3 − u 3 v 2, u 3 v 1 − u 1 v 3, u 1 v 2 − u 2 v 1 〉 · 〈 w 1, w 2, w 3 〉
= (u × v) · w.

Use the properties of the cross product to calculate (i × k) × ⎛⎝k × j⎞⎠.

So far in this section, we have been concerned with the direction of the vector u × v, but we have not discussed its
magnitude. It turns out there is a simple expression for the magnitude of u × v involving the magnitudes of u and v,
and the sine of the angle between them.

Theorem 2.7: Magnitude of the Cross Product
Let u and v be vectors, and let θ be the angle between them. Then, ‖ u × v ‖ = ‖ u ‖ · ‖ v ‖ · sin θ.

Proof
Let u = 〈 u 1, u 2, u 3 〉 and v = 〈 v 1, v 2, v 3 〉 be vectors, and let θ denote the angle between them. Then

− ⎛⎝u 21 v 21 + u 22 v 22 + u 23 v 23 + 2u 1 u 2 v 1 v 2 + 2u 1 u 3 v 1 v 3 + 2u 2 u 3 v 2 v 3⎞⎠

= ‖ u ‖ 2 ‖ v ‖ 2 ⎛⎝1 − cos 2 θ⎞⎠
= ‖ u ‖ 2 ‖ v ‖ 2 ⎛⎝sin 2 θ⎞⎠.

Taking square roots and noting that sin 2 θ = sin θ for 0 ≤ θ ≤ 180°, we have the desired result:

‖ u × v ‖ = ‖ u ‖ ‖ v ‖ sin θ.

This definition of the cross product allows us to visualize or interpret the product geometrically. It is clear, for example, that
the cross product is defined only for vectors in three dimensions, not for vectors in two dimensions. In two dimensions, it is
impossible to generate a vector simultaneously orthogonal to two nonparallel vectors.

Example 2.35
Calculating the Cross Product
Use Properties of the Cross Product to find the magnitude of the cross product of u = 〈 0, 4, 0 〉 and

v = 〈 0, 0, −3 〉 .
Solution
We have

Use Properties of the Cross Product to find the magnitude of u × v, where u = 〈 −8, 0, 0 〉

and v = 〈 0, 2, 0 〉 .

Determinants and the Cross Product
Using Equation 2.9 to find the cross product of two vectors is straightforward, and it presents the cross product in
the useful component form. The formula, however, is complicated and difficult to remember. Fortunately, we have an
alternative. We can calculate the cross product of two vectors using determinant notation.

Equation 2.10 is referred to as the expansion of the determinant along the first row. Notice that the multipliers of each
of the 2 × 2 determinants on the right side of this expression are the entries in the first row of the 3 × 3 determinant.
Furthermore, each of the 2 × 2 determinants contains the entries from the 3 × 3 determinant that would remain if you
crossed out the row and column containing the multiplier. Thus, for the first term on the right, a 1 is the multiplier, and the

2 × 2 determinant contains the entries that remain if you cross out the first row and first column of the 3 × 3 determinant.
Similarly, for the second term, the multiplier is a 2, and the 2 × 2 determinant contains the entries that remain if you cross

out the first row and second column of the 3 × 3 determinant. Notice, however, that the coefficient of the second term is
negative. The third term can be calculated in similar fashion.

Using the Cross Product
The cross product is very useful for several types of calculations, including finding a vector orthogonal to two given vectors,
computing areas of triangles and parallelograms, and even determining the volume of the three-dimensional geometric
shape made of parallelograms known as a parallelepiped. The following examples illustrate these calculations.

Example 2.38

Let a = 〈 5, 2, −1 〉 and b = 〈 0, −1, 4 〉 . Find a unit vector orthogonal to both a and b.

To use the cross product for calculating areas, we state and prove the following theorem.

Theorem 2.8: Area of a Parallelogram
If we locate vectors u and v such that they form adjacent sides of a parallelogram, then the area of the parallelogram
is given by ‖ u × v ‖ (Figure 2.57).

Figure 2.57 The parallelogram with adjacent sides u and v
has base ‖ u ‖ and height ‖ v ‖ sin θ.

Proof
We show that the magnitude of the cross product is equal to the base times height of the parallelogram.

The Triple Scalar Product
Because the cross product of two vectors is a vector, it is possible to combine the dot product and the cross product. The
dot product of a vector with the cross product of two other vectors is called the triple scalar product because the result is a
scalar.

Definition
The triple scalar product of vectors u,

v, and w is u · (v × w).

176

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Theorem 2.9: Calculating a Triple Scalar Product
The triple scalar product of vectors u = u 1 i + u 2 j + u 3 k,

v = v 1 i + v 2 j + v 3 k, and w = w 1 i + w 2 j + w 3 k

is the determinant of the 3 × 3 matrix formed by the components of the vectors:

| |

u1 u2 u3
u · (v × w) = v 1 v 2 v 3 .

Proof
The calculation is straightforward.

u · (v × w) = 〈 u 1, u 2, u 3 〉 · 〈 v 2 w 3 − v 3 w 2, −v 1 w 3 + v 3 w 1, v 1 w 2 − v 2 w 1 〉
= u 1 (v 2 w 3 − v 3 w 2) + u 2 (−v 1 w 3 + v 3 w 1) + u 3 (v 1 w 2 − v 2 w 1)

Calculate the triple scalar product a · (b × c), where a = 〈 2, −4, 1 〉 ,

b = 〈 0, 3, −1 〉 , and

c = 〈 5, −3, 3 〉 .
When we create a matrix from three vectors, we must be careful about the order in which we list the vectors. If we list them
in a matrix in one order and then rearrange the rows, the absolute value of the determinant remains unchanged. However,
each time two rows switch places, the determinant changes sign:

| | | | | | | |
a1 a2 a3
b1 b2 b3 = d
c1 c2 c3

b1 b2 b3
a 1 a 2 a 3 = −d
c1 c2 c3

b1 b2 b3
c1 c2 c3 = d
a1 a2 a3

c1 c2 c3
b 1 b 2 b 3 = −d.
a1 a2 a3

Verifying this fact is straightforward, but rather messy. Let’s take a look at this with an example:

Rearranging vectors in the triple products is equivalent to reordering the rows in the matrix of the determinant. Let
u = u 1 i + u 2 j + u 3 k, v = v 1 i + v 2 j + v 3 k, and w = w 1 i + w 2 j + w 3 k. Applying Calculating a Triple Scalar
Product, we have

| |

u1 u2 u3
u · (v × w) = v 1 v 2 v 3
w1 w2 w3

| |

u1 u2 u3
and u · (w × v) = w 1 w 2 w 3 .
v1 v2 v3

We can obtain the determinant for calculating u · (w × v) by switching the bottom two rows of u · (v × w). Therefore,

u · (v × w) = −u · (w × v).

Following this reasoning and exploring the different ways we can interchange variables in the triple scalar product lead to
the following identities:

u · (v × w) = −u · (w × v)
u · (v × w) = v · (w × u) = w · (u × v).
Let u and v be two vectors in standard position. If u and v are not scalar multiples of each other, then these vectors form
adjacent sides of a parallelogram. We saw in Area of a Parallelogram that the area of this parallelogram is ‖ u × v ‖ .
Now suppose we add a third vector w that does not lie in the same plane as u and v but still shares the same initial
point. Then these vectors form three edges of a parallelepiped, a three-dimensional prism with six faces that are each
parallelograms, as shown in Figure 2.59. The volume of this prism is the product of the figure’s height and the area of its
base. The triple scalar product of u, v, and w provides a simple method for calculating the volume of the parallelepiped
defined by these vectors.

Theorem 2.10: Volume of a Parallelepiped
The volume of a parallelepiped with adjacent edges given by the vectors u, v, and w is the absolute value of the
triple scalar product:

V = |u · (v × w)|.
See Figure 2.59.

Note that, as the name indicates, the triple scalar product produces a scalar. The volume formula just presented uses the
absolute value of a scalar quantity.

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Figure 2.59 The height of the parallelepiped is given by

‖ proj v×w u ‖ .

Proof
The area of the base of the parallelepiped is given by ‖ v × w ‖ . The height of the figure is given by ‖ proj v×w u ‖ .
The volume of the parallelepiped is the product of the height and the area of the base, so we have

V = ‖ proj v × w u ‖ ‖ v × w ‖

Applications of the Cross Product
The cross product appears in many practical applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering. Let’s examine some
of these applications here, including the idea of torque, with which we began this section. Other applications show up in
later chapters, particularly in our study of vector fields such as gravitational and electromagnetic fields (Introduction to
Vector Calculus).

Example 2.42
Using the Triple Scalar Product
Use the triple scalar product to show that vectors u = 〈 2, 0, 5 〉 , v = 〈 2, 2, 4 〉 , and w = 〈 1, −1, 3 〉
are coplanar—that is, show that these vectors lie in the same plane.

=2−2
= 0.
The volume of the parallelepiped is 0 units3, so one of the dimensions must be zero. Therefore, the three vectors
all lie in the same plane.

2.41

Are the vectors a = i + j − k,

b = i − j + k, and c = i + j + k coplanar?

Example 2.43
Finding an Orthogonal Vector
Only a single plane can pass through any set of three noncolinear points. Find a vector orthogonal to the plane

Solution

→

The plane must contain vectors PQ and QR :

→
PQ = 〈 1 − 9, 3 − (−3), 0 − (−2) 〉 = 〈 −8, 6, 2 〉
→
QR = 〈 −2 − 1, 5 − 3, 0 − 0 〉 = 〈 −3, 2, 0 〉 .
→

The cross product PQ × QR produces a vector orthogonal to both PQ and QR . Therefore, the cross product

We have seen how to use the triple scalar product and how to find a vector orthogonal to a plane. Now we apply the cross
product to real-world situations.
Sometimes a force causes an object to rotate. For example, turning a screwdriver or a wrench creates this kind of rotational
effect, called torque.

Definition
Torque, τ (the Greek letter tau), measures the tendency of a force to produce rotation about an axis of rotation. Let r
be a vector with an initial point located on the axis of rotation and with a terminal point located at the point where the
force is applied, and let vector F represent the force. Then torque is equal to the cross product of r and F:

τ = r × F.
See Figure 2.61.

Figure 2.61 Torque measures how a force causes an object to
rotate.

Think about using a wrench to tighten a bolt. The torque τ applied to the bolt depends on how hard we push the wrench
(force) and how far up the handle we apply the force (distance). The torque increases with a greater force on the wrench
at a greater distance from the bolt. Common units of torque are the newton-meter or foot-pound. Although torque is

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

181

dimensionally equivalent to work (it has the same units), the two concepts are distinct. Torque is used specifically in the
context of rotation, whereas work typically involves motion along a line.

Example 2.44
Evaluating Torque
A bolt is tightened by applying a force of 6 N to a 0.15-m wrench (Figure 2.62). The angle between the wrench
and the force vector is 40°. Find the magnitude of the torque about the center of the bolt. Round the answer to
two decimal places.

Figure 2.62 Torque describes the twisting action of the
wrench.

Solution
Substitute the given information into the equation defining torque:

‖ τ ‖ = ‖ r × F ‖ = ‖ r ‖ ‖ F ‖ sin θ = (0.15 m)(6 N)sin 40° ≈ 0.58 N · m.

direction, and a line through two given points.

2.5.5 Find the angle between two planes.
By now, we are familiar with writing equations that describe a line in two dimensions. To write an equation for a line,
we must know two points on the line, or we must know the direction of the line and at least one point through which the
line passes. In two dimensions, we use the concept of slope to describe the orientation, or direction, of a line. In three
dimensions, we describe the direction of a line using a vector parallel to the line. In this section, we examine how to use
equations to describe lines and planes in space.

Equations for a Line in Space
Let’s first explore what it means for two vectors to be parallel. Recall that parallel vectors must have the same or opposite
directions. If two nonzero vectors, u and v, are parallel, we claim there must be a scalar, k, such that u = kv. If u
and v have the same direction, simply choose k =

‖u‖
‖u‖
. If u and v have opposite directions, choose k = −
.
‖v‖
‖v‖

Note that the converse holds as well. If u = kv for some scalar k, then either u and v have the same direction (k > 0)

or opposite directions (k < 0), so u and v are parallel. Therefore, two nonzero vectors u and v are parallel if and only
if u = kv for some scalar k. By convention, the zero vector 0 is considered to be parallel to all vectors.

As in two dimensions, we can describe a line in space using a point on the line and the direction of the line, or a parallel
vector, which we call the direction vector (Figure 2.63). Let L be a line in space passing through point P(x 0, y 0, z 0).

→

Let v = 〈 a, b, c 〉 be a vector parallel to L. Then, for any point on line Q(x, y, z), we know that PQ is parallel to

→
v. Thus, as we just discussed, there is a scalar, t, such that PQ = tv, which gives
→
PQ = tv
〈 x − x 0, y − y 0, z − z 0 〉 = t 〈 a, b, c 〉
〈 x − x 0, y − y 0, z − z 0 〉 = 〈 ta, tb, tc 〉 .

→

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

187

Using vector operations, we can rewrite Equation 2.11 as

〈 x − x 0, y − y 0, z − z 0 〉
〈 x, y, z 〉 − 〈 x 0, y 0, z 0 〉
〈 x, y, z 〉

= 〈 ta, tb, tc 〉
= t 〈 a, b, c 〉
= 〈 x 0, y 0, z 0 〉 + t 〈 a, b, c 〉 .

Setting r = 〈 x, y, z 〉 and r 0 = 〈 x 0, y 0, z 0 〉 , we now have the vector equation of a line:

r = r 0 + tv.

(2.12)

Equating components, Equation 2.11 shows that the following equations are simultaneously true: x − x 0 = ta,

y − y 0 = tb, and z − z 0 = tc. If we solve each of these equations for the component variables x, y, and z, we get a set

of equations in which each variable is defined in terms of the parameter t and that, together, describe the line. This set of
three equations forms a set of parametric equations of a line:

x = x 0 + ta

y = y 0 + tb

z = z 0 + tc.

If we solve each of the equations for t assuming a, b, and c are nonzero, we get a different description of the same line:

x − x0
a =t

y − y0
=t
b

z − z0
c = t.

Because each expression equals t, they all have the same value. We can set them equal to each other to create symmetric
equations of a line:

x − x0 y − y0 z − z0
a = b = c .
We summarize the results in the following theorem.

Theorem 2.11: Parametric and Symmetric Equations of a Line
A line L parallel to vector v = 〈 a, b, c 〉 and passing through point P(x 0, y 0, z 0) can be described by the
following parametric equations:

x = x 0 + ta, y = y 0 + tb, and z = z 0 + tc.

(2.13)

If the constants a, b, and c are all nonzero, then L can be described by the symmetric equation of the line:

x − x0 y − y0 z − z0
a = b = c .

(2.14)

The parametric equations of a line are not unique. Using a different parallel vector or a different point on the line leads to
a different, equivalent representation. Each set of parametric equations leads to a related set of symmetric equations, so it
follows that a symmetric equation of a line is not unique either.

Example 2.45
Equations of a Line in Space
Find parametric and symmetric equations of the line passing through points (1, 4, −2) and (−3, 5, 0).

Solution
First, identify a vector parallel to the line:

188

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

v = 〈 −3 − 1, 5 − 4, 0 − (−2) 〉 = 〈 −4, 1, 2 〉 .
Use either of the given points on the line to complete the parametric equations:

x = 1 − 4t, y = 4 + t, and z = −2 + 2t.
Solve each equation for t to create the symmetric equation of the line:

x − 1 = y − 4 = z + 2.
−4
2

2.43

Find parametric and symmetric equations of the line passing through points (1, −3, 2) and (5, −2, 8).

Sometimes we don’t want the equation of a whole line, just a line segment. In this case, we limit the values of our
parameter t. For example, let P(x 0, y 0, z 0) and Q(x 1, y 1, z 1) be points on a line, and let p = 〈 x 0, y 0, z 0 〉 and

q = 〈 x 1, y 1, z 1 〉 be the associated position vectors. In addition, let r = 〈 x, y, z 〉 . We want to find a vector

P and Q. Using P as our known point on the line, and
→
PQ = 〈 x 1 − x 0, y 1 − y 0, z 1 − z 0 〉 as the direction vector equation, Equation 2.12 gives

equation for the line segment between

⎛→⎞
r = p + t⎝PQ ⎠.

Using properties of vectors, then

⎛→⎞
r = p + t⎝PQ ⎠

= 〈 x 0, y 0, z 0 〉 + t 〈 x 1 − x 0, y 1 − y 0, z 1 − z 0 〉

= 〈 x 0, y 0, z 0 〉 + t⎛⎝ 〈 x 1, y 1, z 1 〉 − 〈 x 0, y 0, z 0 〉 ⎞⎠
= 〈 x 0, y 0, z 0 〉 + t 〈 x 1, y 1, z 1 〉 − t 〈 x 0, y 0, z 0 〉
= (1 − t) 〈 x 0, y 0, z 0 〉 + t 〈 x 1, y 1, z 1 〉
= (1 − t)p + tq.

Thus, the vector equation of the line passing through P and Q is

r = (1 − t)p + tq.
Remember that we didn’t want the equation of the whole line, just the line segment between P and Q. Notice that when

t = 0, we have r = p, and when t = 1, we have r = q. Therefore, the vector equation of the line segment between
P and Q is
r = (1 − t)p + tq, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

(2.15)

Going back to Equation 2.12, we can also find parametric equations for this line segment. We have
⎛→⎞
r = p + t⎝PQ ⎠

〈 x, y, z 〉

=
=

〈 x 0, y 0, z 0 〉 + t 〈 x 1 − x 0, y 1 − y 0, z 1 − z 0 〉
〈 x 0 + t(x 1 − x 0), y 0 + t(y 1 − y 0), z 0 + t(z 1 − z 0) 〉 .

Then, the parametric equations are

x = x 0 + t(x 1 − x 0), y = y 0 + t(y 1 − y 0), z = z 0 + t(z 1 − z 0), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

Example 2.46
Parametric Equations of a Line Segment
Find parametric equations of the line segment between the points P(2, 1, 4) and Q(3, −1, 3).

Solution
By Equation 2.16, we have

x = x 0 + t(x 1 − x 0), y = y 0 + t(y 1 − y 0), z = z 0 + t(z 1 − z 0), 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
Working with each component separately, we get

x = x 0 + t(x 1 − x 0)
= 2 + t(3 − 2)
= 2 + t,
y = y 0 + t(y 1 − y 0)
= 1 + t(−1 − 1)
= 1 − 2t,
and

z = z 0 + t(z 1 − z 0)
= 4 + t(3 − 4)
= 4 − t.
Therefore, the parametric equations for the line segment are

x = 2 + t, y = 1 − 2t, z = 4 − t, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

Find parametric equations of the line segment between points P(−1, 3, 6) and Q(−8, 2, 4).

Distance between a Point and a Line
We already know how to calculate the distance between two points in space. We now expand this definition to describe the
distance between a point and a line in space. Several real-world contexts exist when it is important to be able to calculate
these distances. When building a home, for example, builders must consider “setback” requirements, when structures or
fixtures have to be a certain distance from the property line. Air travel offers another example. Airlines are concerned about
the distances between populated areas and proposed flight paths.
Let L be a line in the plane and let M be any point not on the line. Then, we define distance d from M to L as the

—

—

length of line segment MP, where P is a point on L such that MP is perpendicular to L (Figure 2.64).

190

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Figure 2.64 The distance from point M to line L is the

—

length of MP.

When we’re looking for the distance between a line and a point in space, Figure 2.64 still applies. We still define the
distance as the length of the perpendicular line segment connecting the point to the line. In space, however, there is no clear
way to know which point on the line creates such a perpendicular line segment, so we select an arbitrary point on the line
and use properties of vectors to calculate the distance. Therefore, let P be an arbitrary point on line L and let v be a
direction vector for L (Figure 2.65).

→

Figure 2.65 Vectors PM and v form two sides of a
parallelogram with base ‖ v ‖ and height d, which is the
distance between a line and a point in space.

→

By Area of a Parallelogram, vectors PM and v form two sides of a parallelogram with area ‖ PM × v ‖ . Using a
formula from geometry, the area of this parallelogram can also be calculated as the product of its base and height:

→
‖ PM × v ‖ = ‖ v ‖ d.
We can use this formula to find a general formula for the distance between a line in space and any point not on the line.

Relationships between Lines
Given two lines in the two-dimensional plane, the lines are equal, they are parallel but not equal, or they intersect in a single
point. In three dimensions, a fourth case is possible. If two lines in space are not parallel, but do not intersect, then the lines
are said to be skew lines (Figure 2.67).

Figure 2.67 In three dimensions, it is possible that two lines
do not cross, even when they have different directions.

To classify lines as parallel but not equal, equal, intersecting, or skew, we need to know two things: whether the direction
vectors are parallel and whether the lines share a point (Figure 2.68).

Figure 2.68 Determine the relationship between two lines based on whether
their direction vectors are parallel and whether they share a point.

Example 2.48

determine whether the lines intersect, we see if there is a point, (x, y, z), that lies on both lines. To find
this point, we use the parametric equations to create a system of equalities:

2s − 1 = t − 3;

s − 1 = 3t + 8;

s − 4 = 5 − 2t.

By the first equation, t = 2s + 2. Substituting into the second equation yields

There is no single point that satisfies the parametric equations for L 1 and L 2 simultaneously. These lines
do not intersect, so they are skew (see the following figure).

b. Line L1 has direction vector v 1 = 〈 1, −1, 1 〉 and passes through the origin, (0, 0, 0). Line L 2 has
a different direction vector, v 2 = 〈 2, 1, 1 〉 , so these lines are not parallel or equal. Let r represent
the parameter for line L 1 and let s represent the parameter for L 2 :

x =r
y = −r
z =r

x = 2s + 3
y =s
z = s + 2.

Solve the system of equations to find r = 1 and s = − 1. If we need to find the point of intersection, we
can substitute these parameters into the original equations to get (1, −1, 1) (see the following figure).

c. Lines L 1 and L 2 have equivalent direction vectors: v = 〈 6, −2, 3 〉 . These two lines are parallel
(see the following figure).

Describe the relationship between the lines with the following parametric equations:

Equations for a Plane
We know that a line is determined by two points. In other words, for any two distinct points, there is exactly one line that
passes through those points, whether in two dimensions or three. Similarly, given any three points that do not all lie on the
same line, there is a unique plane that passes through these points. Just as a line is determined by two points, a plane is
determined by three.
This may be the simplest way to characterize a plane, but we can use other descriptions as well. For example, given two
distinct, intersecting lines, there is exactly one plane containing both lines. A plane is also determined by a line and any

point that does not lie on the line. These characterizations arise naturally from the idea that a plane is determined by three
points. Perhaps the most surprising characterization of a plane is actually the most useful.
Imagine a pair of orthogonal vectors that share an initial point. Visualize grabbing one of the vectors and twisting it.
As you twist, the other vector spins around and sweeps out a plane. Here, we describe that concept mathematically. Let

→
n = 〈 a, b, c 〉 be a vector and P = (x 0, y 0, z 0) be a point. Then the set of all points Q = (x, y, z) such that PQ is

orthogonal to n forms a plane (Figure 2.69). We say that n is a normal vector, or perpendicular to the plane. Remember,

→

the dot product of orthogonal vectors is zero. This fact generates the vector equation of a plane: n · PQ = 0. Rewriting
this equation provides additional ways to describe the plane:

→
n · PQ = 0
〈 a, b, c 〉 · 〈 x − x 0, y − y 0, z − z 0 〉 = 0
a(x − x 0) + b(y − y 0) + c(z − z 0) = 0.

Figure 2.69 Given a point P and vector n, the set of all

→

points Q with PQ orthogonal to n forms a plane.

Definition
→

Given a point P and vector n, the set of all points Q satisfying the equation n · PQ = 0 forms a plane. The
equation

→
n · PQ = 0

(2.17)

is known as the vector equation of a plane.
The scalar equation of a plane containing point P = (x 0, y 0, z 0) with normal vector n = 〈 a, b, c 〉 is

a(x − x 0) + b(y − y 0) + c(z − z 0) = 0.

(2.18)

This equation can be expressed as ax + by + cz + d = 0, where d = −ax 0 − by 0 − cz 0. This form of the equation
is sometimes called the general form of the equation of a plane.
As described earlier in this section, any three points that do not all lie on the same line determine a plane. Given three such
points, we can find an equation for the plane containing these points.

Example 2.49
Writing an Equation of a Plane Given Three Points in the Plane
Write an equation for the plane containing points P = (1, 1, −2),
both standard and general forms.

Q = (0, 2, 1), and R = (−1, −1, 0) in

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Solution
To write an equation for a plane, we must find a normal vector for the plane. We start by identifying two vectors
in the plane:

→
PQ =
→
QR =
→

〈 0 − 1, 2 − 1, 1 − (−2) 〉 = 〈 −1, 1, 3 〉
〈 −1 − 0, −1 − 2, 0 − 1 〉 = 〈 −1, −3, −1 〉 .

→

→

→

The cross product PQ × QR is orthogonal to both PQ and QR , so it is normal to the plane that contains
these two vectors:

→
→
n = PQ × QR
i j k
= −1 1 3
−1 −3 −1
= (−1 + 9)i − (1 + 3)j + (3 + 1)k
= 8i − 4j + 4k.

| |

Thus, n = 〈 8, −4, 4 〉 , and we can choose any of the three given points to write an equation of the plane:

8(x − 1) − 4(y − 1) + 4(z + 2) = 0
8x − 4y + 4z + 4 = 0.

The scalar equations of a plane vary depending on the normal vector and point chosen.

Example 2.50
Writing an Equation for a Plane Given a Point and a Line
Find an equation of the plane that passes through point (1, 4, 3) and contains the line given by

x=

y−1
= z + 1.
2

Solution
Symmetric equations describe the line that passes through point (0, 1, −1) parallel to vector v 1 = 〈 1, 2, 1 〉

(see the following figure). Use this point and the given point, (1, 4, 3), to identify a second vector parallel to
the plane:

v 2 = 〈 1 − 0, 4 − 1, 3 − (−1) 〉 = 〈 1, 3, 4 〉 .
Use the cross product of these vectors to identify a normal vector for the plane:

n = v1 × v2
i j k
= 1 2 1
1 3 4
= (8 − 3)i − (4 − 1)j + (3 − 2)k
= 5i − 3j + k.

Now that we can write an equation for a plane, we can use the equation to find the distance d between a point P and the
plane. It is defined as the shortest possible distance from P to a point on the plane.

Figure 2.70 We want to find the shortest distance from point
P to the plane. Let point R be the point in the plane such that,
for any other point in the plane Q,

Just as we find the two-dimensional distance between a point and a line by calculating the length of a line segment
perpendicular to the line, we find the three-dimensional distance between a point and a plane by calculating the length of a

Parallel and Intersecting Planes
We have discussed the various possible relationships between two lines in two dimensions and three dimensions. When we
describe the relationship between two planes in space, we have only two possibilities: the two distinct planes are parallel or
they intersect. When two planes are parallel, their normal vectors are parallel. When two planes intersect, the intersection is
a line (Figure 2.71).

Figure 2.71 The intersection of two nonparallel planes is
always a line.

We can use the equations of the two planes to find parametric equations for the line of intersection.

Example 2.52
Finding the Line of Intersection for Two Planes
Find parametric and symmetric equations for the line formed by the intersection of the planes given by
x + y + z = 0 and 2x − y + z = 0 (see the following figure).

200

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Solution
Note that the two planes have nonparallel normals, so the planes intersect. Further, the origin satisfies each
equation, so we know the line of intersection passes through the origin. Add the plane equations so we can
eliminate the one of the variables, in this case, y:

x + y + z = 0
2x
− y + z = 0
____________________
3x
+ 2z = 0.
This gives us x = − 2 z. We substitute this value into the first equation to express y in terms of z:

3

x+y+z = 0
− 2z + y + z = 0
3
y + 1z = 0
3
y = − 1 z.
3
We now have the first two variables, x and y, in terms of the third variable, z. Now we define z in terms
of t. To eliminate the need for fractions, we choose to define the parameter t as t = − 1 z. Then, z = −3t.

3

Substituting the parametric representation of z back into the other two equations, we see that the parametric
equations for the line of intersection are x = 2t, y = t, z = −3t. The symmetric equations for the line are

x =y= z .

In addition to finding the equation of the line of intersection between two planes, we may need to find the angle formed by
the intersection of two planes. For example, builders constructing a house need to know the angle where different sections

of the roof meet to know whether the roof will look good and drain properly. We can use normal vectors to calculate the
angle between the two planes. We can do this because the angle between the normal vectors is the same as the angle between
the planes. Figure 2.72 shows why this is true.

Figure 2.72 The angle between two planes has the same
measure as the angle between the normal vectors for the planes.

We can find the measure of the angle θ between two intersecting planes by first finding the cosine of the angle, using the
following equation:

cos θ =

|n 1 · n 2| .
‖ n1 ‖ ‖ n2 ‖

We can then use the angle to determine whether two planes are parallel or orthogonal or if they intersect at some other angle.

Example 2.53
Finding the Angle between Two Planes

orthogonal, find the measure of the angle between them. Give the answer in radians and round to two decimal

b.

2x − 3y + 2z = 3 and 6x + 2y − 3z = 1

c.

x + y + z = 4 and x − 3y + 5z = 1

Solution
a. The normal vectors for these planes are n 1 = 〈 1, 2, −1 〉 and n 2 = 〈 2, 4, −2 〉 . These two vectors
are scalar multiples of each other. The normal vectors are parallel, so the planes are parallel.
b. The normal vectors for these planes are n 1 = 〈 2, −3, 2 〉 and n 2 = 〈 6, 2, −3 〉 . Taking the dot
product of these vectors, we have

n 1 · n 2 = 〈 2, −3, 2 〉 · 〈 6, 2, −3 〉 = 2(6) − 3(2) + 2(−3) = 0.
The normal vectors are orthogonal, so the corresponding planes are orthogonal as well.
c. The normal vectors for these planes are n 1 = 〈 1, 1, 1 〉 and n 2 = 〈 1, −3, 5 〉 :

2.50

Find the measure of the angle between planes x + y − z = 3 and 3x − y + 3z = 5. Give the answer in

radians and round to two decimal places.
When we find that two planes are parallel, we may need to find the distance between them. To find this distance, we simply
select a point in one of the planes. The distance from this point to the other plane is the distance between the planes.
Previously, we introduced the formula for calculating this distance in Equation 2.19:

d=

→

,
‖n‖

where Q is a point on the plane, P is a point not on the plane, and n is the normal vector that passes through point Q.
Consider the distance from point (x 0, y 0, z 0) to plane ax + by + cz + k = 0. Let (x 1, y 1, z 1) be any point in the plane.
Substituting into the formula yields

Distance between Two Skew Lines

Figure 2.73 Industrial pipe installations often feature pipes running in
different directions. How can we find the distance between two skew pipes?

Finding the distance from a point to a line or from a line to a plane seems like a pretty abstract procedure. But, if the
lines represent pipes in a chemical plant or tubes in an oil refinery or roads at an intersection of highways, confirming
that the distance between them meets specifications can be both important and awkward to measure. One way is to
model the two pipes as lines, using the techniques in this chapter, and then calculate the distance between them. The
calculation involves forming vectors along the directions of the lines and using both the cross product and the dot
product.
The symmetric forms of two lines, L 1 and L 2, are

You are to develop a formula for the distance d between these two lines, in terms of the values
a 1, b 1, c 1; a 2, b 2, c 2; x 1, y 1, z 1; and x 2, y 2, z 2. The distance between two lines is usually taken to mean the
minimum distance, so this is the length of a line segment or the length of a vector that is perpendicular to both lines
and intersects both lines.
1. First, write down two vectors, v 1 and v 2, that lie along L 1 and L 2, respectively.
2. Find the cross product of these two vectors and call it N. This vector is perpendicular to v 1 and v 2, and

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

205

hence is perpendicular to both lines.
3. From vector N, form a unit vector n in the same direction.
4. Use symmetric equations to find a convenient vector v 12 that lies between any two points, one on each line.
Again, this can be done directly from the symmetric equations.
5. The dot product of two vectors is the magnitude of the projection of one vector onto the other—that is,
A · B = ‖ A ‖ ‖ B ‖ cos θ, where θ is the angle between the vectors. Using the dot product, find the
projection of vector v 12 found in step 4 onto unit vector n found in step 3. This projection is perpendicular

to both lines, and hence its length must be the perpendicular distance d between them. Note that the value of
d may be negative, depending on your choice of vector v 12 or the order of the cross product, so use absolute
value signs around the numerator.
6. Check that your formula gives the correct distance of |−25|/ 198 ≈ 1.78 between the following two lines:

7. Is your general expression valid when the lines are parallel? If not, why not? (Hint: What do you know about
the value of the cross product of two parallel vectors? Where would that result show up in your expression for

d?)

8. Demonstrate that your expression for the distance is zero when the lines intersect. Recall that two lines intersect
if they are not parallel and they are in the same plane. Hence, consider the direction of n and v 12. What is
the result of their dot product?
9. Consider the following application. Engineers at a refinery have determined they need to install support struts
between many of the gas pipes to reduce damaging vibrations. To minimize cost, they plan to install these struts
at the closest points between adjacent skewed pipes. Because they have detailed schematics of the structure,
they are able to determine the correct lengths of the struts needed, and hence manufacture and distribute them
to the installation crews without spending valuable time making measurements.
The rectangular frame structure has the dimensions 4.0 × 15.0 × 10.0 m (height, width, and depth). One
sector has a pipe entering the lower corner of the standard frame unit and exiting at the diametrically opposed
corner (the one farthest away at the top); call this L 1. A second pipe enters and exits at the two different
opposite lower corners; call this L 2 (Figure 2.74).

Figure 2.74 Two pipes cross through a standard frame unit.

Write down the vectors along the lines representing those pipes, find the cross product between them from
which to create the unit vector n, define a vector that spans two points on each line, and finally determine the
minimum distance between the lines. (Take the origin to be at the lower corner of the first pipe.) Similarly, you
may also develop the symmetric equations for each line and substitute directly into your formula.

2.6 | Quadric Surfaces
Learning Objectives
2.6.1 Identify a cylinder as a type of three-dimensional surface.
2.6.2 Recognize the main features of ellipsoids, paraboloids, and hyperboloids.
2.6.3 Use traces to draw the intersections of quadric surfaces with the coordinate planes.
We have been exploring vectors and vector operations in three-dimensional space, and we have developed equations to
describe lines, planes, and spheres. In this section, we use our knowledge of planes and spheres, which are examples of
three-dimensional figures called surfaces, to explore a variety of other surfaces that can be graphed in a three-dimensional
coordinate system.

Identifying Cylinders
The first surface we’ll examine is the cylinder. Although most people immediately think of a hollow pipe or a soda straw
when they hear the word cylinder, here we use the broad mathematical meaning of the term. As we have seen, cylindrical
surfaces don’t have to be circular. A rectangular heating duct is a cylinder, as is a rolled-up yoga mat, the cross-section of
which is a spiral shape.
In the two-dimensional coordinate plane, the equation x 2 + y 2 = 9 describes a circle centered at the origin with radius 3.
In three-dimensional space, this same equation represents a surface. Imagine copies of a circle stacked on top of each other
centered on the z-axis (Figure 2.75), forming a hollow tube. We can then construct a cylinder from the set of lines parallel
to the z-axis passing through circle x 2 + y 2 = 9 in the xy-plane, as shown in the figure. In this way, any curve in one of the
coordinate planes can be extended to become a surface.

Figure 2.75 In three-dimensional space, the graph of equation

x 2 + y 2 = 9 is a cylinder with radius 3 centered on the

z-axis. It continues indefinitely in the positive and negative
directions.

Definition
A set of lines parallel to a given line passing through a given curve is known as a cylindrical surface, or cylinder. The
parallel lines are called rulings.
From this definition, we can see that we still have a cylinder in three-dimensional space, even if the curve is not a circle.
Any curve can form a cylinder, and the rulings that compose the cylinder may be parallel to any given line (Figure 2.76).

212

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Figure 2.76 In three-dimensional space, the graph of equation

z = x 3 is a cylinder, or a cylindrical surface with rulings

parallel to the y-axis.

Example 2.55
Graphing Cylindrical Surfaces
Sketch the graphs of the following cylindrical surfaces.
a.

x 2 + z 2 = 25

b.

z = 2x 2 − y

c.

y = sin x

Solution
a. The variable y can take on any value without limit. Therefore, the lines ruling this surface are parallel
to the y-axis. The intersection of this surface with the xz-plane forms a circle centered at the origin with
radius 5 (see the following figure).

213

Figure 2.77 The graph of equation x 2 + z 2 = 25 is a

cylinder with radius 5 centered on the y-axis.

b. In this case, the equation contains all three variables — x, y, and z — so none of the variables can
vary arbitrarily. The easiest way to visualize this surface is to use a computer graphing utility (see the
following figure).

Figure 2.78

c. In this equation, the variable z can take on any value without limit. Therefore, the lines composing
this surface are parallel to the z-axis. The intersection of this surface with the yz-plane outlines curve
y = sin x (see the following figure).

214

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Figure 2.79 The graph of equation y = sin x is formed by a set of
lines parallel to the z-axis passing through curve y = sin x in the
xy-plane.

2.52

Sketch or use a graphing tool to view the graph of the cylindrical surface defined by equation z = y 2.

When sketching surfaces, we have seen that it is useful to sketch the intersection of the surface with a plane parallel to one
of the coordinate planes. These curves are called traces. We can see them in the plot of the cylinder in Figure 2.80.

Definition
The traces of a surface are the cross-sections created when the surface intersects a plane parallel to one of the
coordinate planes.

215

Figure 2.80 (a) This is one view of the graph of equation z = sin x. (b) To find the trace of the graph in the

xz-plane, set y = 0. The trace is simply a two-dimensional sine wave.

Traces are useful in sketching cylindrical surfaces. For a cylinder in three dimensions, though, only one set of traces is
useful. Notice, in Figure 2.80, that the trace of the graph of z = sin x in the xz-plane is useful in constructing the graph.
The trace in the xy-plane, though, is just a series of parallel lines, and the trace in the yz-plane is simply one line.
Cylindrical surfaces are formed by a set of parallel lines. Not all surfaces in three dimensions are constructed so simply,
however. We now explore more complex surfaces, and traces are an important tool in this investigation.

Quadric Surfaces
We have learned about surfaces in three dimensions described by first-order equations; these are planes. Some other
common types of surfaces can be described by second-order equations. We can view these surfaces as three-dimensional
extensions of the conic sections we discussed earlier: the ellipse, the parabola, and the hyperbola. We call these graphs
quadric surfaces.

Definition
Quadric surfaces are the graphs of equations that can be expressed in the form

Ax 2 + By 2 + Cz 2 + Dxy + Exz + Fyz + Gx + Hy + Jz + K = 0.
When a quadric surface intersects a coordinate plane, the trace is a conic section.

An ellipsoid is a surface described by an equation of the form x 2 + 2 + z 2 = 1. Set x = 0 to see the trace of the

ellipsoid in the yz-plane. To see the traces in the y- and xz-planes, set z = 0 and y = 0, respectively. Notice that, if

a = b, the trace in the xy-plane is a circle. Similarly, if a = c, the trace in the xz-plane is a circle and, if b = c, then
the trace in the yz-plane is a circle. A sphere, then, is an ellipsoid with a = b = c.

Now that we know what traces of this solid look like, we can sketch the surface in three dimensions (Figure

Figure 2.82 (a) The traces provide a framework for the
surface. (b) The center of this ellipsoid is the origin.

The trace of an ellipsoid is an ellipse in each of the coordinate planes. However, this does not have to be the case for all
quadric surfaces. Many quadric surfaces have traces that are different kinds of conic sections, and this is usually indicated
2

y2

by the name of the surface. For example, if a surface can be described by an equation of the form x 2 + 2 = cz , then we

call that surface an elliptic paraboloid. The trace in the xy-plane is an ellipse, but the traces in the xz-plane and yz-plane
are parabolas (Figure 2.83). Other elliptic paraboloids can have other orientations simply by interchanging the variables

Solution
y2

To find the trace in the xy-plane, set z = 0: x 2 + 2 = 0. The trace in the plane z = 0 is simply one point, the
2
origin. Since a single point does not tell us what the shape is, we can move up the z-axis to an arbitrary plane to
find the shape of other traces of the figure.

y2

The trace in plane z = 5 is the graph of equation x 2 + 2 = 1, which is an ellipse. In the xz-plane, the equation
2
becomes z = 5x 2. The trace is a parabola in this plane and in any plane with the equation y = b.

In planes parallel to the yz-plane, the traces are also parabolas, as we can see in the following figure.

Hyperboloids of one sheet have some fascinating properties. For example, they can be constructed using straight lines, such
as in the sculpture in Figure 2.85(a). In fact, cooling towers for nuclear power plants are often constructed in the shape
of a hyperboloid. The builders are able to use straight steel beams in the construction, which makes the towers very strong
while using relatively little material (Figure 2.85(b)).

If the surface of a parabolic reflector is described by equation x +

= z , where is the focal point of the
4

reflector?

Figure 2.86 Energy reflects off of the parabolic reflector and is collected at the focal point. (credit: modification of
CGP Grey, Wikimedia Commons)

Solution
Since z is the first-power variable, the axis of the reflector corresponds to the z-axis. The coefficients of x 2 and

y 2 are equal, so the cross-section of the paraboloid perpendicular to the z-axis is a circle. We can consider a
trace in the xz-plane or the yz-plane; the result is the same. Setting y = 0, the trace is a parabola opening up
along the z-axis, with standard equation x 2 = 4pz, where p is the focal length of the parabola. In this case,

this equation becomes x 2 = 100 · z = 4pz or 25 = 4p. So p is 6.25 m, which tells us that the focus of the

4

paraboloid is 6.25 m up the axis from the vertex. Because the vertex of this surface is the origin, the focal point
is (0, 0, 6.25).

Seventeen standard quadric surfaces can be derived from the general equation

a.

16x 2 + 9y 2 + 16z 2 = 144

b.

9x 2 − 18x + 4y 2 + 16y − 36z + 25 = 0

Solution
a. The x, y, and z terms are all squared, and are all positive, so this is probably an ellipsoid. However,
let’s put the equation into the standard form for an ellipsoid just to be sure. We have

16x 2 + 9y 2 + 16z 2 = 144.
Dividing through by 144 gives
2
x 2 + y + z 2 = 1.
9 16 9

So, this is, in fact, an ellipsoid, centered at the origin.
b. We first notice that the z term is raised only to the first power, so this is either an elliptic paraboloid or a
hyperbolic paraboloid. We also note there are x terms and y terms that are not squared, so this quadric
surface is not centered at the origin. We need to complete the square to put this equation in one of the
standard forms. We have

9x 2 − 18x + 4y 2 + 16y − 36z + 25 = 0

9x 2 − 18x + 4y 2 + 16y + 25 = 36z

9⎛⎝x 2 − 2x⎞⎠ + 4⎛⎝y 2 + 4y⎞⎠ + 25 = 36z

2.7.4 Convert from rectangular to spherical coordinates.
The Cartesian coordinate system provides a straightforward way to describe the location of points in space. Some surfaces,
however, can be difficult to model with equations based on the Cartesian system. This is a familiar problem; recall that
in two dimensions, polar coordinates often provide a useful alternative system for describing the location of a point in the
plane, particularly in cases involving circles. In this section, we look at two different ways of describing the location of
points in space, both of them based on extensions of polar coordinates. As the name suggests, cylindrical coordinates are
useful for dealing with problems involving cylinders, such as calculating the volume of a round water tank or the amount of
oil flowing through a pipe. Similarly, spherical coordinates are useful for dealing with problems involving spheres, such as
finding the volume of domed structures.

Cylindrical Coordinates
When we expanded the traditional Cartesian coordinate system from two dimensions to three, we simply added a new
axis to model the third dimension. Starting with polar coordinates, we can follow this same process to create a new threedimensional coordinate system, called the cylindrical coordinate system. In this way, cylindrical coordinates provide a
natural extension of polar coordinates to three dimensions.

Definition
In the cylindrical coordinate system, a point in space (Figure 2.89) is represented by the ordered triple (r, θ, z),
where
•

(r, θ) are the polar coordinates of the point’s projection in the xy-plane

•

z is the usual z-coordinate in the Cartesian coordinate system

Figure 2.89 The right triangle lies in the xy-plane. The length
of the hypotenuse is r and θ is the measure of the angle
formed by the positive x-axis and the hypotenuse. The
z-coordinate describes the location of the point above or below
the xy-plane.

In the xy-plane, the right triangle shown in Figure 2.89 provides the key to transformation between cylindrical and
Cartesian, or rectangular, coordinates.

Theorem 2.15: Conversion between Cylindrical and Cartesian Coordinates
The rectangular coordinates (x, y, z) and the cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z) of a point are related as follows:

x = r cos θ
y = r sin θ
z = z
and
r 2 = x2 + y2
y
tan θ = x
z = z

These equations are used to convert from
cylindrical coordinates to rectangular
coordinates.
These equations are used to convert from
rectangular coordinates to cylindrical
coordinates.

As when we discussed conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates in two dimensions, it should be noted

y

that the equation tan θ = x has an infinite number of solutions. However, if we restrict θ to values between 0 and 2π,
then we can find a unique solution based on the quadrant of the xy-plane in which original point (x, y, z) is located. Note
that if x = 0, then the value of θ is either π , 3π , or 0, depending on the value of y.

2

2

Notice that these equations are derived from properties of right triangles. To make this easy to see, consider point P in
the xy-plane with rectangular coordinates ⎛⎝x, y, 0⎞⎠ and with cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, 0), as shown in the following
figure.

230

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Figure 2.90 The Pythagorean theorem provides equation

r 2 = x 2 + y 2. Right-triangle relationships tell us that
x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, and tan θ = y/x.

Let’s consider the differences between rectangular and cylindrical coordinates by looking at the surfaces generated when
each of the coordinates is held constant. If c is a constant, then in rectangular coordinates, surfaces of the form x = c,

y = c, or z = c are all planes. Planes of these forms are parallel to the yz-plane, the xz-plane, and the xy-plane,
respectively. When we convert to cylindrical coordinates, the z-coordinate does not change. Therefore, in cylindrical
coordinates, surfaces of the form z = c are planes parallel to the xy-plane. Now, let’s think about surfaces of the form
r = c. The points on these surfaces are at a fixed distance from the z-axis. In other words, these surfaces are vertical circular
cylinders. Last, what about θ = c ? The points on a surface of the form θ = c are at a fixed angle from the x-axis, which
gives us a half-plane that starts at the z-axis (Figure 2.91 and Figure 2.92).

Figure 2.91 In rectangular coordinates, (a) surfaces of the form x = c are planes parallel
to the yz-plane, (b) surfaces of the form y = c are planes parallel to the xz-plane, and (c)
surfaces of the form z = c are planes parallel to the xy-plane.

Figure 2.92 In cylindrical coordinates, (a) surfaces of the form r = c are vertical cylinders
of radius r, (b) surfaces of the form θ = c are half-planes at angle θ from the x-axis, and
(c) surfaces of the form z = c are planes parallel to the xy-plane.

Converting from Rectangular to Cylindrical Coordinates
Convert the rectangular coordinates (1, −3, 5) to cylindrical coordinates.

Solution
Use the second set of equations from Conversion between Cylindrical and Cartesian Coordinates to
translate from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates:

r 2 = x2 + y2
r = ± 1 2 + (−3) 2 = ± 10.
We choose the positive square root, so r = 10. Now, we apply the formula to find θ. In this case, y is negative
and x is positive, which means we must select the value of θ between 3π and 2π:

Convert point (−8, 8, −7) from Cartesian coordinates to cylindrical coordinates.

The use of cylindrical coordinates is common in fields such as physics. Physicists studying electrical charges and the
capacitors used to store these charges have discovered that these systems sometimes have a cylindrical symmetry. These
systems have complicated modeling equations in the Cartesian coordinate system, which make them difficult to describe
and analyze. The equations can often be expressed in more simple terms using cylindrical coordinates. For example, the
cylinder described by equation x 2 + y 2 = 25 in the Cartesian system can be represented by cylindrical equation r = 5.

a. When the angle θ is held constant while r and z are allowed to vary, the result is a half-plane (see the

b. Substitute r 2 = x 2 + y 2 into equation r 2 + z 2 = 9 to express the rectangular form of the equation:

x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = 9. This equation describes a sphere centered at the origin with radius 3 (see the
following figure).

234

Chapter 2 | Vectors in Space

Figure 2.95 The sphere centered at the origin with radius 3
can be described by the cylindrical equation r 2 + z 2 = 9.

c. To describe the surface defined by equation z = r, is it useful to examine traces parallel to the xy-plane.
For example, the trace in plane z = 1 is circle r = 1, the trace in plane z = 3 is circle r = 3, and so
on. Each trace is a circle. As the value of z increases, the radius of the circle also increases. The resulting
surface is a cone (see the following figure).

circles. The radius of the circles increases as z increases.

Describe the surface with cylindrical equation r = 6.

Spherical Coordinates
In the Cartesian coordinate system, the location of a point in space is described using an ordered triple in which each
coordinate represents a distance. In the cylindrical coordinate system, location of a point in space is described using two
distances (r and z) and an angle measure (θ). In the spherical coordinate system, we again use an ordered triple to describe
the location of a point in space. In this case, the triple describes one distance and two angles. Spherical coordinates make
it simple to describe a sphere, just as cylindrical coordinates make it easy to describe a cylinder. Grid lines for spherical
coordinates are based on angle measures, like those for polar coordinates.

Definition
In the spherical coordinate system, a point P in space (Figure 2.97) is represented by the ordered triple (ρ, θ, φ)
where
•

ρ (the Greek letter rho) is the distance between P and the origin ⎛⎝ρ ≠ 0⎞⎠;

•

θ is the same angle used to describe the location in cylindrical coordinates;

•

—
φ (the Greek letter phi) is the angle formed by the positive z-axis and line segment OP , where O is the
origin and 0 ≤ φ ≤ π.

The formulas to convert from spherical coordinates to rectangular coordinates may seem complex, but they are
straightforward applications of trigonometry. Looking at Figure 2.98, it is easy to see that r = ρ sin φ. Then, looking at
the triangle in the xy-plane with r as its hypotenuse, we have x = r cos θ = ρ sin φ cos θ. The derivation of the formula
for y is similar. Figure 2.96 also shows that ρ 2 = r 2 + z 2 = x 2 + y 2 + z 2 and z = ρ cos φ. Solving this last equation

As we did with cylindrical coordinates, let’s consider the surfaces that are generated when each of the coordinates is held
constant. Let c be a constant, and consider surfaces of the form ρ = c. Points on these surfaces are at a fixed distance
from the origin and form a sphere. The coordinate θ in the spherical coordinate system is the same as in the cylindrical
coordinate system, so surfaces of the form θ = c are half-planes, as before. Last, consider surfaces of the form φ = 0.
The points on these surfaces are at a fixed angle from the z-axis and form a half-cone (Figure 2.99).

Figure 2.99 In spherical coordinates, surfaces of the form ρ = c are spheres of
radius ρ (a), surfaces of the form θ = c are half-planes at an angle θ from the
x-axis (b), and surfaces of the form ϕ = c are half-cones at an angle ϕ from the
z-axis (c).

Spherical coordinates are useful in analyzing systems that have some degree of symmetry about a point, such as the
volume of the space inside a domed stadium or wind speeds in a planet’s atmosphere. A sphere that has Cartesian equation
x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = c 2 has the simple equation ρ = c in spherical coordinates.
In geography, latitude and longitude are used to describe locations on Earth’s surface, as shown in Figure 2.104. Although
the shape of Earth is not a perfect sphere, we use spherical coordinates to communicate the locations of points on Earth.
Let’s assume Earth has the shape of a sphere with radius 4000 mi. We express angle measures in degrees rather than
radians because latitude and longitude are measured in degrees.

Figure 2.104 In the latitude–longitude system, angles
describe the location of a point on Earth relative to the equator
and the prime meridian.

Let the center of Earth be the center of the sphere, with the ray from the center through the North Pole representing the
positive z-axis. The prime meridian represents the trace of the surface as it intersects the xz-plane. The equator is the trace
of the sphere intersecting the xy-plane.

Example 2.66
Converting Latitude and Longitude to Spherical Coordinates
The latitude of Columbus, Ohio, is 40° N and the longitude is 83° W, which means that Columbus is 40°
north of the equator. Imagine a ray from the center of Earth through Columbus and a ray from the center of Earth
through the equator directly south of Columbus. The measure of the angle formed by the rays is 40°. In the same
way, measuring from the prime meridian, Columbus lies 83° to the west. Express the location of Columbus in
spherical coordinates.

Solution
The radius of Earth is 4000 mi, so ρ = 4000. The intersection of the prime meridian and the equator lies on
the positive x-axis. Movement to the west is then described with negative angle measures, which shows that
θ = −83°, Because Columbus lies 40° north of the equator, it lies 50° south of the North Pole, so φ = 50°.
In spherical coordinates, Columbus lies at point (4000, −83°, 50°).

Sydney, Australia is at 34°S and 151°E. Express Sydney’s location in spherical coordinates.

Cylindrical and spherical coordinates give us the flexibility to select a coordinate system appropriate to the problem at hand.
A thoughtful choice of coordinate system can make a problem much easier to solve, whereas a poor choice can lead to
unnecessarily complex calculations. In the following example, we examine several different problems and discuss how to
select the best coordinate system for each one.

Example 2.67
Choosing the Best Coordinate System
In each of the following situations, we determine which coordinate system is most appropriate and describe how
we would orient the coordinate axes. There could be more than one right answer for how the axes should be
oriented, but we select an orientation that makes sense in the context of the problem. Note: There is not enough
information to set up or solve these problems; we simply select the coordinate system (Figure 2.105).
a. Find the center of gravity of a bowling ball.
b. Determine the velocity of a submarine subjected to an ocean current.
c. Calculate the pressure in a conical water tank.
d. Find the volume of oil flowing through a pipeline.

Solution
a. Clearly, a bowling ball is a sphere, so spherical coordinates would probably work best here. The origin
should be located at the physical center of the ball. There is no obvious choice for how the x-, y- and
z-axes should be oriented. Bowling balls normally have a weight block in the center. One possible choice
is to align the z-axis with the axis of symmetry of the weight block.
b. A submarine generally moves in a straight line. There is no rotational or spherical symmetry that applies
in this situation, so rectangular coordinates are a good choice. The z-axis should probably point upward.
The x- and y-axes could be aligned to point east and north, respectively. The origin should be some
convenient physical location, such as the starting position of the submarine or the location of a particular
port.
c. A cone has several kinds of symmetry. In cylindrical coordinates, a cone can be represented by equation
z = kr, where k is a constant. In spherical coordinates, we have seen that surfaces of the form φ = c
are half-cones. Last, in rectangular coordinates, elliptic cones are quadric surfaces and can be represented
2

y2

by equations of the form z 2 = x 2 + 2 . In this case, we could choose any of the three. However, the
a
b
equation for the surface is more complicated in rectangular coordinates than in the other two systems, so
we might want to avoid that choice. In addition, we are talking about a water tank, and the depth of the
water might come into play at some point in our calculations, so it might be nice to have a component
that represents height and depth directly. Based on this reasoning, cylindrical coordinates might be the
best choice. Choose the z-axis to align with the axis of the cone. The orientation of the other two axes is
arbitrary. The origin should be the bottom point of the cone.
d. A pipeline is a cylinder, so cylindrical coordinates would be best the best choice. In this case, however, we
would likely choose to orient our z-axis with the center axis of the pipeline. The x-axis could be chosen
to point straight downward or to some other logical direction. The origin should be chosen based on the
problem statement. Note that this puts the z-axis in a horizontal orientation, which is a little different from

245

what we usually do. It may make sense to choose an unusual orientation for the axes if it makes sense for
the problem.
e. A football has rotational symmetry about a central axis, so cylindrical coordinates would work best. The
z-axis should align with the axis of the ball. The origin could be the center of the ball or perhaps one of
the ends. The position of the x-axis is arbitrary.

KEY CONCEPTS
2.1 Vectors in the Plane
• Vectors are used to represent quantities that have both magnitude and direction.
• We can add vectors by using the parallelogram method or the triangle method to find the sum. We can multiply a
vector by a scalar to change its length or give it the opposite direction.
• Subtraction of vectors is defined in terms of adding the negative of the vector.
• A vector is written in component form as v = 〈 x, y 〉 .
• The magnitude of a vector is a scalar: ‖ v ‖ = x 2 + y 2.
• A unit vector u has magnitude 1 and can be found by dividing a vector by its magnitude: u =

1 v. The
‖v‖

standard unit vectors are i = 〈 1, 0 〉 and j = 〈 0, 1 〉 . A vector v = 〈 x, y 〉 can be expressed in terms of the
standard unit vectors as v = xi + yj.
• Vectors are often used in physics and engineering to represent forces and velocities, among other quantities.

2.2 Vectors in Three Dimensions
• The three-dimensional coordinate system is built around a set of three axes that intersect at right angles at a single
point, the origin. Ordered triples (x, y, z) are used to describe the location of a point in space.
• The distance d between points (x 1, y 1, z 1) and (x 2, y 2, z 2) is given by the formula

d = (x 2 − x 1) 2 + (y 2 − y 1) 2 + (z 2 − z 1) 2.

• In three dimensions, the equations x = a, y = b, and z = c describe planes that are parallel to the coordinate
planes.
• The standard equation of a sphere with center (a, b, c) and radius r is

(x − a) 2 + ⎛⎝y − b⎞⎠ 2 + (z − c) 2 = r 2.
• In three dimensions, as in two, vectors are commonly expressed in component form, v = 〈 x, y, z 〉 , or in terms

of the standard unit vectors, xi + yj + zk.
• Properties of vectors in space are a natural extension of the properties for vectors in a plane. Let
v = 〈 x 1, y 1, z 1 〉 and w = 〈 x 2, y 2, z 2 〉 be vectors, and let k be a scalar.
◦ Scalar multiplication: kv = 〈 kx 1, ky 1, kz 1 〉
◦ Vector addition: v + w = 〈 x 1, y 1, z 1 〉 + 〈 x 2, y 2, z 2 〉 = 〈 x 1 + x 2, y 1 + y 2, z 1 + z 2 〉
◦ Vector subtraction: v − w = 〈 x 1, y 1, z 1 〉 − 〈 x 2, y 2, z 2 〉 = 〈 x 1 − x 2, y 1 − y 2, z 1 − z 2 〉
◦ Vector magnitude: ‖ v ‖ = x 1 2 + y 1 2 + z 1 2
◦ Unit vector in the direction of v:

2.3 The Dot Product
• The dot product, or scalar product, of two vectors u = 〈 u 1, u 2, u 3 〉

u · v = u 1 v 1 + u 2 v 2 + u 3 v 3.

and v = 〈 v 1, v 2, v 3 〉

is

• The dot product satisfies the following properties:
◦

u·v = v·u

◦

u · (v + w) = u · v + u · w

◦

c(u · v) = (cu) · v = u · (cv)

◦

v·v = ‖ v ‖ 2

• The dot product of two vectors can be expressed, alternatively, as u · v = ‖ u ‖ ‖ v ‖ cos θ. This form of the dot
product is useful for finding the measure of the angle formed by two vectors.
• Vectors u and v are orthogonal if u · v = 0.
• The angles formed by a nonzero vector and the coordinate axes are called the direction angles for the vector. The
cosines of these angles are known as the direction cosines.
• The vector projection of v onto u is the vector proj u v =

u · v u. The magnitude of this vector is known as the
‖u‖2

scalar projection of v onto u, given by comp u v = u · v .

‖u‖

• Work is done when a force is applied to an object, causing displacement. When the force is represented by the
vector F and the displacement is represented by the vector s, then the work done W is given by the formula

W = F · s = ‖ F ‖ ‖ s ‖ cos θ.

2.4 The Cross Product
• The cross product u × v of two vectors u = 〈 u 1, u 2, u 3 〉 and v = 〈 v 1, v 2, v 3 〉 is a vector orthogonal to
both u and v. Its length is given by ‖ u × v ‖ = ‖ u ‖ · ‖ v ‖ · sin θ, where θ is the angle between u and

v. Its direction is given by the right-hand rule.
• The algebraic formula for calculating the cross product of two vectors,
u = 〈 u 1, u 2, u 3 〉 and v = 〈 v 1, v 2, v 3 〉 , is

u × v = (u 2 v 3 − u 3 v 2)i − (u 1 v 3 − u 3 v 1)j + (u 1 v 2 − u 2 v 1)k.

• The cross product satisfies the following properties for vectors u, v, and w, and scalar c:
◦

u × v = −(v × u)

◦

u × (v + w) = u × v + u × w

◦

c(u × v) = (cu) × v = u × (cv)

• If vectors u and v form adjacent sides of a parallelogram, then the area of the parallelogram is given by

‖ u×v ‖ .

• The triple scalar product of vectors u,

v, and w is u · (v × w).

• The volume of a parallelepiped with adjacent edges given by vectors u, v, and w is V = |u · (v × w)|.
• If the triple scalar product of vectors u, v, and w is zero, then the vectors are coplanar. The converse is also true:
If the vectors are coplanar, then their triple scalar product is zero.
• The cross product can be used to identify a vector orthogonal to two given vectors or to a plane.
• Torque τ measures the tendency of a force to produce rotation about an axis of rotation. If force F is acting at a
distance r from the axis, then torque is equal to the cross product of r and F: τ = r × F.

2.5 Equations of Lines and Planes in Space
• In three dimensions, the direction of a line is described by a direction vector. The vector equation of a line
with direction vector v = 〈 a, b, c 〉 passing through point P = (x 0, y 0, z 0) is r = r 0 + tv, where

r 0 = 〈 x 0, y 0, z 0 〉 is the position vector of point P. This equation can be rewritten to form the parametric

equations of the line: x = x 0 + ta,

y = y 0 + tb, and z = z 0 + tc. The line can also be described with the
x − x0 y − y0 z − z0
symmetric equations
a = b = c .

• Let L be a line in space passing through point P with direction vector v. If Q is any point not on L, then the
distance from Q to L is d =

• Given a point P and vector n, the set of all points Q satisfying equation n · PQ = 0 forms a plane. Equation

n · PQ = 0 is known as the vector equation of a plane.

• The scalar equation of a plane containing point P = (x 0, y 0, z 0) with normal vector n = 〈 a, b, c 〉

a(x − x 0) + b(y − y 0) + c(z − z 0) = 0. This equation can be expressed as ax + by + cz + d = 0,

is

where

d = −ax 0 − by 0 − cz 0. This form of the equation is sometimes called the general form of the equation of a plane.
• Suppose a plane with normal vector n passes through point Q. The distance D from the plane to point P not in
the plane is given by

2.6 Quadric Surfaces
• A set of lines parallel to a given line passing through a given curve is called a cylinder, or a cylindrical surface. The
parallel lines are called rulings.
• The intersection of a three-dimensional surface and a plane is called a trace. To find the trace in the xy-, yz-, or
xz-planes, set z = 0, x = 0, or y = 0, respectively.
• Quadric surfaces are three-dimensional surfaces with traces composed of conic sections. Every quadric surface can
be expressed with an equation of the form Ax 2 + By 2 + Cz 2 + Dxy + Exz + Fyz + Gx + Hy + Jz + K = 0.
• To sketch the graph of a quadric surface, start by sketching the traces to understand the framework of the surface.
• Important quadric surfaces are summarized in Figure 2.87 and Figure 2.88.

2.7 Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates
• In the cylindrical coordinate system, a point in space is represented by the ordered triple (r, θ, z), where (r, θ)
represents the polar coordinates of the point’s projection in the xy-plane and z represents the point’s projection onto
the z-axis.

y = r sin θ,

and z = z.

the distance between P and the origin ⎛⎝ρ ≠ 0⎞⎠,

coordinates, and φ is the angle formed by the positive z-axis and line segment OP , where O is the origin and

Introduction
In 1705, using Sir Isaac Newton’s new laws of motion, the astronomer Edmond Halley made a prediction. He stated that
comets that had appeared in 1531, 1607, and 1682 were actually the same comet and that it would reappear in 1758. Halley
was proved to be correct, although he did not live to see it. However, the comet was later named in his honor.
Halley’s Comet follows an elliptical path through the solar system, with the Sun appearing at one focus of the ellipse. This
motion is predicted by Johannes Kepler’s first law of planetary motion, which we mentioned briefly in the Introduction
to Parametric Equations and Polar Coordinates. In Example 3.15, we show how to use Kepler’s third law of
planetary motion along with the calculus of vector-valued functions to find the average distance of Halley’s Comet from the
Sun.
Vector-valued functions provide a useful method for studying various curves both in the plane and in three-dimensional
space. We can apply this concept to calculate the velocity, acceleration, arc length, and curvature of an object’s trajectory.
In this chapter, we examine these methods and show how they are used.

3.1 | Vector-Valued Functions and Space Curves
Learning Objectives
3.1.1 Write the general equation of a vector-valued function in component form and unit-vector
form.
3.1.2 Recognize parametric equations for a space curve.
3.1.3 Describe the shape of a helix and write its equation.
3.1.4 Define the limit of a vector-valued function.
Our study of vector-valued functions combines ideas from our earlier examination of single-variable calculus with our
description of vectors in three dimensions from the preceding chapter. In this section we extend concepts from earlier
chapters and also examine new ideas concerning curves in three-dimensional space. These definitions and theorems support
the presentation of material in the rest of this chapter and also in the remaining chapters of the text.

Definition of a Vector-Valued Function
Our first step in studying the calculus of vector-valued functions is to define what exactly a vector-valued function is. We
can then look at graphs of vector-valued functions and see how they define curves in both two and three dimensions.

Definition
A vector-valued function is a function of the form

r(t) = f (t)i + g(t) j or

r(t) = f (t)i + g(t) j + h(t)k,

(3.1)

where the component functions f, g, and h, are real-valued functions of the parameter t. Vector-valued functions are
also written in the form

r(t) = 〈 f (t), g(t) 〉

or

r(t) = 〈 f (t), g(t), h(t) 〉 .

(3.2)

In both cases, the first form of the function defines a two-dimensional vector-valued function; the second form
describes a three-dimensional vector-valued function.
The parameter t can lie between two real numbers: a ≤ t ≤ b. Another possibility is that the value of t might take on all
real numbers. Last, the component functions themselves may have domain restrictions that enforce restrictions on the value
of t. We often use t as a parameter because t can represent time.

To determine whether this function has any domain restrictions, consider the component functions
separately. The first component function is f (t) = 4cost and the second component function is

g(t) = 3sint.

Neither of these functions has a domain restriction, so the domain of

r(t) = 4cost i + 3sint j is all real numbers.

To determine whether this function has any domain restrictions, consider the component functions
separately. The first component function is f (t) = 3tant, the second component function is

g(t) = 4sect, and the third component function is h(t) = 5t. The first two functions are not defined
for odd multiples of π/2,

so the function is not defined for odd multiples of π/2. Therefore,

For the vector-valued function r(t) = ⎛⎝t 2 − 3t⎞⎠ i + (4t + 1) j, evaluate r(0), r(1), and r(−4). Does this

function have any domain restrictions?
Example 3.1 illustrates an important concept. The domain of a vector-valued function consists of real numbers. The
domain can be all real numbers or a subset of the real numbers. The range of a vector-valued function consists of vectors.
Each real number in the domain of a vector-valued function is mapped to either a two- or a three-dimensional vector.

Graphing Vector-Valued Functions
Recall that a plane vector consists of two quantities: direction and magnitude. Given any point in the plane (the initial point),
if we move in a specific direction for a specific distance, we arrive at a second point. This represents the terminal point of
the vector. We calculate the components of the vector by subtracting the coordinates of the initial point from the coordinates

262

Chapter 3 | Vector-Valued Functions

of the terminal point.
A vector is considered to be in standard position if the initial point is located at the origin. When graphing a vector-valued
function, we typically graph the vectors in the domain of the function in standard position, because doing so guarantees the
uniqueness of the graph. This convention applies to the graphs of three-dimensional vector-valued functions as well. The
graph of a vector-valued function of the form r(t) = f (t)i + g(t) j consists of the set of all (t, r(t)), and the path it traces
is called a plane curve. The graph of a vector-valued function of the form r(t) = f (t)i + g(t) j + h(t)k consists of the set
of all (t, r(t)), and the path it traces is called a space curve. Any representation of a plane curve or space curve using a
vector-valued function is called a vector parameterization of the curve.

Example 3.2
Graphing a Vector-Valued Function
Create a graph of each of the following vector-valued functions:
a. The plane curve represented by r(t) = 4cost i + 3sint j,

0 ≤ t ≤ 2π

b. The plane curve represented by r(t) = 4cost 3 i + 3sint 3 j,

0 ≤ t ≤ 2π

c. The space curve represented by r(t) = cost i + sint j + t k,

0 ≤ t ≤ 4π

Solution
a. As with any graph, we start with a table of values. We then graph each of the vectors in the second column
of the table in standard position and connect the terminal points of each vector to form a curve (Figure
3.2). This curve turns out to be an ellipse centered at the origin.

becomes r(t) = cost i + sint j, which is a unit circle centered at the origin.

Figure 3.4 The graph of the third vector-valued function is a
helix.

You may notice that the graphs in parts a. and b. are identical. This happens because the function describing curve
b is a so-called reparameterization of the function describing curve a. In fact, any curve has an infinite number of
reparameterizations; for example, we can replace t with 2t in any of the three previous curves without changing the shape
of the curve. The interval over which t is defined may change, but that is all. We return to this idea later in this chapter when
we study arc-length parameterization.
As mentioned, the name of the shape of the curve of the graph in Example 3.2c. is a helix (Figure 3.4). The curve
resembles a spring, with a circular cross-section looking down along the z-axis. It is possible for a helix to be elliptical in
cross-section as well. For example, the vector-valued function r(t) = 4cost i + 3sint j + t k describes an elliptical helix.
The projection of this helix into the x, y-plane is an ellipse. Last, the arrows in the graph of this helix indicate the
orientation of the curve as t progresses from 0 to 4π.

3.2

Create a graph of the vector-valued function r(t) = ⎛⎝t 2 − 1⎞⎠ i + (2t − 3) j,

0 ≤ t ≤ 3.

At this point, you may notice a similarity between vector-valued functions and parameterized curves. Indeed, given a vectorvalued function r(t) = f (t)i + g(t) j, we can define x = f (t) and y = g(t). If a restriction exists on the values of t (for
example, t is restricted to the interval ⎡⎣a, b⎤⎦ for some constants a < b), then this restriction is enforced on the parameter.
The graph of the parameterized function would then agree with the graph of the vector-valued function, except that the
vector-valued graph would represent vectors rather than points. Since we can parameterize a curve defined by a function
y = f (x), it is also possible to represent an arbitrary plane curve by a vector-valued function.

Limits and Continuity of a Vector-Valued Function
We now take a look at the limit of a vector-valued function. This is important to understand to study the calculus of vectorvalued functions.

Chapter 3 | Vector-Valued Functions

Definition
A vector-valued function r approaches the limit L as t approaches a, written

lim r(t) = L,

t→a

provided
t → a||

lim r(t) − L|| = 0.

This is a rigorous definition of the limit of a vector-valued function. In practice, we use the following theorem:

Theorem 3.1: Limit of a Vector-Valued Function
Let f, g, and h be functions of t. Then the limit of the vector-valued function r(t) = f (t)i + g(t) j as t approaches a is
given by

In the following example, we show how to calculate the limit of a vector-valued function.

Learning Objectives
3.2.1 Write an expression for the derivative of a vector-valued function.
3.2.2 Find the tangent vector at a point for a given position vector.
3.2.3 Find the unit tangent vector at a point for a given position vector and explain its
significance.
3.2.4 Calculate the definite integral of a vector-valued function.
To study the calculus of vector-valued functions, we follow a similar path to the one we took in studying real-valued
functions. First, we define the derivative, then we examine applications of the derivative, then we move on to defining
integrals. However, we will find some interesting new ideas along the way as a result of the vector nature of these functions
and the properties of space curves.

Derivatives of Vector-Valued Functions
Now that we have seen what a vector-valued function is and how to take its limit, the next step is to learn how to differentiate
a vector-valued function. The definition of the derivative of a vector-valued function is nearly identical to the definition of
a real-valued function of one variable. However, because the range of a vector-valued function consists of vectors, the same
is true for the range of the derivative of a vector-valued function.

Definition
The derivative of a vector-valued function r(t) is

r′(t) = lim

Δt → 0

r(t + Δt) − r(t)
,
Δt

(3.5)

provided the limit exists. If r′(t) exists, then r is differentiable at t. If r′(t) exists for all t in an open interval (a, b),
then r is differentiable over the interval (a, b). For the function to be differentiable over the closed interval ⎡⎣a, b⎤⎦,
the following two limits must exist as well:

r′(a) =

lim

Δt → 0+

r(a + Δt) − r(a)
r(b + Δt) − r(b)
and r′(b) = lim −
.
Δt
Δt
Δt → 0

Many of the rules for calculating derivatives of real-valued functions can be applied to calculating the derivatives of vectorvalued functions as well. Recall that the derivative of a real-valued function can be interpreted as the slope of a tangent line
or the instantaneous rate of change of the function. The derivative of a vector-valued function can be understood to be an
instantaneous rate of change as well; for example, when the function represents the position of an object at a given point in
time, the derivative represents its velocity at that same point in time.
We now demonstrate taking the derivative of a vector-valued function.

Example 3.4
Finding the Derivative of a Vector-Valued Function
Use the definition to calculate the derivative of the function

r(t) = (3t + 4)i + ⎛⎝t 2 − 4t + 3⎞⎠ j.

3.4

Use the definition to calculate the derivative of the function r(t) = ⎛⎝2t 2 + 3⎞⎠ i + (5t − 6) j.

Notice that in the calculations in Example 3.4, we could also obtain the answer by first calculating the derivative of each
component function, then putting these derivatives back into the vector-valued function. This is always true for calculating
the derivative of a vector-valued function, whether it is in two or three dimensions. We state this in the following theorem.
The proof of this theorem follows directly from the definitions of the limit of a vector-valued function and the derivative of
a vector-valued function.

Theorem 3.2: Differentiation of Vector-Valued Functions
Let f, g, and h be differentiable functions of t.
i. If r(t) = f (t)i + g(t) j, then r′(t) = f ′ (t)i + g′ (t) j.
ii. If r(t) = f (t)i + g(t) j + h(t)k, then r′(t) = f ′ (t)i + g′ (t) j + h′ (t)k.

Example 3.5
Calculating the Derivative of Vector-Valued Functions
Use Differentiation of Vector-Valued Functions to calculate the derivative of each of the following
functions.
a.

r(t) = (6t + 8)i + ⎛⎝4t 2 + 2t − 3⎞⎠ j

b.

r(t) = 3cost i + 4sint j

c.

r(t) = e t sint i + e t cost j − e 2t k

Solution
We use Differentiation of Vector-Valued Functions and what we know about differentiating functions of
one variable.

272

Chapter 3 | Vector-Valued Functions

a. The first component of r(t) = (6t + 8)i + ⎛⎝4t 2 + 2t − 3⎞⎠ j is f (t) = 6t + 8. The second component
is

g(t) = 4t 2 + 2t − 3.

We have

f ′ (t) = 6

and

g′ (t) = 8t + 2,

so the theorem gives

r′(t) = 6i + (8t + 2) j.
b. The first component is

f (t) = 3cost and the second component is g(t) = 4sint. We have

f ′ (t) = −3sint and g′ (t) = 4cost, so we obtain r′(t) = −3sint i + 4cost j.
c. The first component of r(t) = e t sint i + e t cost j − e 2t k is f (t) = e t sint,
is g(t) = e t cost,

the second component

and the third component is h(t) = − e 2t. We have f ′ (t) = e t (sint + cost),

g′ (t) = e t (cost − sint),

and

h′ (t) = −2e 2t,

so

the

theorem

gives

r′(t) = e t (sint + cost)i + e t (cost − sint) j − 2e 2t k.

3.5

Calculate the derivative of the function

r(t) = (t lnt)i + ⎛⎝5e t⎞⎠ j + (cost − sint)k.
We can extend to vector-valued functions the properties of the derivative that we presented in the Introduction to
Derivatives (http://cnx.org/content/m53494/latest/) . In particular, the constant multiple rule, the sum and difference
rules, the product rule, and the chain rule all extend to vector-valued functions. However, in the case of the product rule,
there are actually three extensions: (1) for a real-valued function multiplied by a vector-valued function, (2) for the dot
product of two vector-valued functions, and (3) for the cross product of two vector-valued functions.

Using the Properties of Derivatives of Vector-Valued Functions

Solution

a. We have r′(t) = 6i + (8t + 2) j + 5k and u′(t) = 2t i + 2 j + ⎛⎝3t 2 − 3⎞⎠ k. Therefore, according to
property iv.:

b. First, we need to adapt property v. for this problem:

d ⎡⎣ u(t) × u′(t)⎤⎦ = u′(t) × u′(t) + u(t) × u″(t).

Recall that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero. Furthermore, u″(t) represents the second

Tangent Vectors and Unit Tangent Vectors
Recall from the Introduction to Derivatives (http://cnx.org/content/m53494/latest/) that the derivative at a point
can be interpreted as the slope of the tangent line to the graph at that point. In the case of a vector-valued function,
the derivative provides a tangent vector to the curve represented by the function. Consider the vector-valued function
r(t) = cost i + sint j. The derivative of this function is r′(t) = − sint i + cost j. If we substitute the value t = π/6 into
both functions we get
⎛ ⎞
⎛ ⎞
r⎝π ⎠ = 3 i + 1 j and r′⎝π ⎠ = − 1 i + 3 j.

Notice that the vector r′⎝π ⎠ is tangent to the circle at the point corresponding to t = π/6. This is an example of a tangent

vector to the plane curve defined by r(t) = cost i + sint j.

Definition
Let C be a curve defined by a vector-valued function r, and assume that r′(t) exists when t = t 0. A tangent vector v
at t = t 0 is any vector such that, when the tail of the vector is placed at point r(t 0) on the graph, vector v is tangent

to curve C. Vector r′(t 0) is an example of a tangent vector at point t = t 0. Furthermore, assume that r′(t) ≠ 0. The
principal unit tangent vector at t is defined to be

T(t) =

r′(t)
,
‖r′(t)‖

(3.6)

provided ‖r′(t)‖ ≠ 0.
The unit tangent vector is exactly what it sounds like: a unit vector that is tangent to the curve. To calculate a unit tangent
vector, first find the derivative r′(t). Second, calculate the magnitude of the derivative. The third step is to divide the
derivative by its magnitude.

Integrals of Vector-Valued Functions
We introduced antiderivatives of real-valued functions in Antiderivatives (http://cnx.org/content/m53621/latest/)
and definite integrals of real-valued functions in The Definite Integral (http://cnx.org/content/m53631/latest/) .
Each of these concepts can be extended to vector-valued functions. Also, just as we can calculate the derivative of a vectorvalued function by differentiating the component functions separately, we can calculate the antiderivative in the same
manner. Furthermore, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus applies to vector-valued functions as well.
The antiderivative of a vector-valued function appears in applications. For example, if a vector-valued function represents
the velocity of an object at time t, then its antiderivative represents position. Or, if the function represents the acceleration
of the object at a given time, then the antiderivative represents its velocity.

Definition
Let f, g, and h be integrable real-valued functions over the closed interval ⎡⎣a, b⎤⎦.
1. The indefinite integral of a vector-valued function r(t) = f (t)i + g(t) j is

Since the indefinite integral of a vector-valued function involves indefinite integrals of the component functions, each of
these component integrals contains an integration constant. They can all be different. For example, in the two-dimensional
case, we can have

∫ f (t)dt = F(t) + C 1 and ∫ g(t)dt = G(t) + C 2,
where F and G are antiderivatives of f and g, respectively. Then

∫ f (t)i + g(t) j dt = ⎡⎣ ∫ f (t)dt⎤⎦ i + ⎡⎣ ∫ g(t)dt⎤⎦ j
⎡
⎣

⎦

= ⎛⎝F(t) + C 1⎞⎠ i + ⎛⎝G(t) + C 2⎞⎠ j
= F(t)i + G(t) j + C 1 i + C 2 j
= F(t)i + G(t) j + C,

where C = C 1 i + C 2 j. Therefore, the integration constant becomes a constant vector.

3.3 | Arc Length and Curvature
Learning Objectives
3.3.1 Determine the length of a particle’s path in space by using the arc-length function.
3.3.2 Explain the meaning of the curvature of a curve in space and state its formula.
3.3.3 Describe the meaning of the normal and binormal vectors of a curve in space.
In this section, we study formulas related to curves in both two and three dimensions, and see how they are related to various
properties of the same curve. For example, suppose a vector-valued function describes the motion of a particle in space.
We would like to determine how far the particle has traveled over a given time interval, which can be described by the arc
length of the path it follows. Or, suppose that the vector-valued function describes a road we are building and we want to
determine how sharply the road curves at a given point. This is described by the curvature of the function at that point. We
explore each of these concepts in this section.

Arc Length for Vector Functions
We have seen how a vector-valued function describes a curve in either two or three dimensions. Recall Alternative
Formulas for Curvature, which states that the formula for the arc length of a curve defined by the parametric functions
x = x(t), y = y(t), t 1 ≤ t ≤ t 2 is given by

s=∫

t2
t1

(x′ (t)) 2 + ⎛⎝y′ (t)⎞⎠ 2dt.

In a similar fashion, if we define a smooth curve using a vector-valued function r(t) = f (t) i + g(t) j, where a ≤ t ≤ b,
the arc length is given by the formula

s=∫

b
a

⎛
⎝

f ′ (t)⎞⎠ 2 + ⎛⎝g′ (t)⎞⎠ 2dt.

In three dimensions, if the vector-valued function is described by r(t) = f (t) i + g(t) j + h(t)k over the same interval

a ≤ t ≤ b, the arc length is given by
s=∫

b
a

⎛
⎝

f ′ (t)⎞⎠ 2 + ⎛⎝g′ (t)⎞⎠ 2 + ⎛⎝h′ (t)⎞⎠ 2dt.

The two formulas are very similar; they differ only in the fact that a space curve has three component functions instead of
two. Note that the formulas are defined for smooth curves: curves where the vector-valued function r(t) is differentiable
with a non-zero derivative. The smoothness condition guarantees that the curve has no cusps (or corners) that could make
the formula problematic.

Arc-Length Parameterization
We now have a formula for the arc length of a curve defined by a vector-valued function. Let’s take this one step further
and examine what an arc-length function is.
If a vector-valued function represents the position of a particle in space as a function of time, then the arc-length function
measures how far that particle travels as a function of time. The formula for the arc-length function follows directly from
the formula for arc length:

s(t) = ∫

t
a

⎛
⎝

(3.13)

f ′ (u)⎞⎠ 2 + ⎛⎝g′ (u)⎞⎠ 2 + ⎛⎝h′ (u)⎞⎠ 2du.

If the curve is in two dimensions, then only two terms appear under the square root inside the integral. The reason for using
the independent variable u is to distinguish between time and the variable of integration. Since s(t) measures distance
traveled as a function of time, s′ (t) measures the speed of the particle at any given time. Since we have a formula for s(t)
in Equation 3.13, we can differentiate both sides of the equation:

⎡

t

⎡

t

s′ (t) = d ∫ ⎛⎝ f ′ (u)⎞⎠ 2 + ⎛⎝g′ (u)⎞⎠ 2 + ⎛⎝h′ (u)⎞⎠ 2du
⎦
dt ⎣ a

⎤

= d ∫ ‖ r′(u) ‖ du
⎦
dt ⎣ a
= ‖ r′(t) ‖ .
If we assume that r(t) defines a smooth curve, then the arc length is always increasing, so s′ (t) > 0 for t > a. Last, if

r(t) is a curve on which ‖ r′(t) ‖ = 1 for all t, then
t

a

s(t) = ∫ ‖ r′(u) ‖ du = ∫ 1 du = t − a,
which means that t represents the arc length as long as a = 0.

Chapter 3 | Vector-Valued Functions

Theorem 3.5: Arc-Length Function
Let r(t) describe a smooth curve for t ≥ a. Then the arc-length function is given by
t

s(t) = ∫ ‖ r′(u) ‖ du.

(3.14)

a

Furthermore, ds = ‖ r′(t) ‖ > 0. If ‖ r′(t) ‖ = 1 for all t ≥ a, then the parameter t represents the arc length

dt

from the starting point at t = a.

A useful application of this theorem is to find an alternative parameterization of a given curve, called an arc-length
parameterization. Recall that any vector-valued function can be reparameterized via a change of variables. For example,
if we have a function r(t) = 〈 3cost, 3sint 〉 , 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π that parameterizes a circle of radius 3, we can change the
parameter from t to 4t, obtaining a new parameterization r(t) = 〈 3cos4t, 3sin4t 〉 . The new parameterization still
defines a circle of radius 3, but now we need only use the values 0 ≤ t ≤ π/2 to traverse the circle once.
Suppose that we find the arc-length function s(t) and are able to solve this function for t as a function of s. We can then
reparameterize the original function r(t) by substituting the expression for t back into r(t). The vector-valued function
is now written in terms of the parameter s. Since the variable s represents the arc length, we call this an arc-length
parameterization of the original function r(t). One advantage of finding the arc-length parameterization is that the distance
traveled along the curve starting from s = 0 is now equal to the parameter s. The arc-length parameterization also appears
in the context of curvature (which we examine later in this section) and line integrals, which we study in the Introduction
to Vector Calculus.

Example 3.10
Finding an Arc-Length Parameterization
Find the arc-length parameterization for each of the following curves:
a.

r(t) = 4cost i + 4sint j, t ≥ 0

b.

r(t) = 〈 t + 3, 2t − 4, 2t 〉 , t ≥ 3

Solution
a. First we find the arc-length function using Equation 3.14:

which gives the relationship between the arc length s and the parameter t as s = 4t; so, t = s/4. Next we

⎛ ⎞
r(s) = 4cos⎝ s ⎠ i + 4sin⎝ s ⎠ j.

This is the arc-length parameterization of r(t). Since the original restriction on t was given by t ≥ 0,
the restriction on s becomes s/4 ≥ 0, or s ≥ 0.

= 3t − 9.
Therefore, the relationship between the arc length s and the parameter t is s = 3t − 9, so t = s + 3.
Substituting this into the original function r(t) = 〈 t + 3, 2t − 4, 2t 〉 yields

This is an arc-length parameterization of r(t). The original restriction on the parameter t was t ≥ 3,
so the restriction on s is (s/3) + 3 ≥ 3, or s ≥ 0.

Find the arc-length function for the helix

r(t) = 〈 3cost, 3sint, 4t 〉 , t ≥ 0.
Then, use the relationship between the arc length and the parameter t to find an arc-length parameterization of
r(t).

Curvature
An important topic related to arc length is curvature. The concept of curvature provides a way to measure how sharply a
smooth curve turns. A circle has constant curvature. The smaller the radius of the circle, the greater the curvature.
Think of driving down a road. Suppose the road lies on an arc of a large circle. In this case you would barely have to turn
the wheel to stay on the road. Now suppose the radius is smaller. In this case you would need to turn more sharply to stay
on the road. In the case of a curve other than a circle, it is often useful first to inscribe a circle to the curve at a given point
so that it is tangent to the curve at that point and “hugs” the curve as closely as possible in a neighborhood of the point
(Figure 3.6). The curvature of the graph at that point is then defined to be the same as the curvature of the inscribed circle.

288

Chapter 3 | Vector-Valued Functions

Figure 3.6 The graph represents the curvature of a function
y = f (x). The sharper the turn in the graph, the greater the
curvature, and the smaller the radius of the inscribed circle.

Definition
Let C be a smooth curve in the plane or in space given by r(s), where s is the arc-length parameter. The curvature

κ at s is
κ = ‖ d T ‖ = ‖ T′(s) ‖ .
ds
Visit this website (http://www.openstaxcollege.org/l/20_spacecurve) for more information about the
curvature of a space curve.

The formula in the definition of curvature is not very useful in terms of calculation. In particular, recall that T(t) represents
the unit tangent vector to a given vector-valued function r(t), and the formula for T(t) is T(t) =

r′(t)
. To use the
‖ r′(t) ‖

formula for curvature, it is first necessary to express r(t) in terms of the arc-length parameter s, then find the unit tangent

vector T(s) for the function r(s), then take the derivative of T(s) with respect to s. This is a tedious process. Fortunately,

there are equivalent formulas for curvature.

Theorem 3.6: Alternative Formulas for Curvature
If C is a smooth curve given by r(t), then the curvature κ of C at t is given by

κ=

‖ T′(t) ‖
.
‖ r′(t) ‖

(3.15)

If C is a three-dimensional curve, then the curvature can be given by the formula

κ=

‖ r′(t) × r″(t) ‖
.
‖ r′(t) ‖ 3

(3.16)

If C is the graph of a function y = f (x) and both y′ and y″ exist, then the curvature κ at point (x, y) is given by

κ=

In the case of a three-dimensional curve, we start with the formulas T(t) = ⎛⎝r′(t)⎞⎠/ ‖ r′(t) ‖ and ds/dt = ‖ r′(t) ‖ .
Therefore, r′(t) = (ds/dt)T(t). We can take the derivative of this function using the scalar product formula:

r″(t) = d 2s T(t) + ds T′(t).

2

r′(t) × r″(t) = ⎝ds ⎠ T(t) × T′(t).

Since T′ is parallel to N, and T is orthogonal to N, it follows that T and T′ are orthogonal. This means that

‖ T × T′ ‖ = ‖ T ‖ ‖ T′ ‖ sin(π/2) = ‖ T′ ‖ , so

⎛

⎞

2

r′(t) × r″(t) = ⎝ds ⎠ ‖ T′(t) ‖ .

Now we solve this equation for ‖ T′(t) ‖ and use the fact that ds/dt = ‖ r′(t) ‖ :

‖ T′(t) ‖ =

‖ r′(t) × r″(t) ‖

‖ r′(t) ‖ 2

Then, we divide both sides by ‖ r′(t) ‖ . This gives

This proves Equation 3.16. To prove Equation 3.17, we start with the assumption that curve C is defined by the function
y = f (x). Then, we can define r(t) = x i + f (x) j + 0 k. Using the previous formula for curvature:

r′(t) = i + f ′ (x) j

for any value of x.

The Normal and Binormal Vectors
We have seen that the derivative r′(t) of a vector-valued function is a tangent vector to the curve defined by r(t), and the
unit tangent vector T(t) can be calculated by dividing r′(t) by its magnitude. When studying motion in three dimensions,
two other vectors are useful in describing the motion of a particle along a path in space: the principal unit normal vector
and the binormal vector.

Definition
Let C be a three-dimensional smooth curve represented by r over an open interval I. If T′(t) ≠ 0, then the principal
unit normal vector at t is defined to be

T′(t)
.
‖ T′(t) ‖

(3.18)

B(t) = T(t) × N(t),

(3.19)

N(t) =
The binormal vector at t is defined as
where T(t) is the unit tangent vector.

Note that, by definition, the binormal vector is orthogonal to both the unit tangent vector and the normal vector.
Furthermore, B(t) is always a unit vector. This can be shown using the formula for the magnitude of a cross product

Chapter 3 | Vector-Valued Functions

293

‖ B(t) ‖ = ‖ T(t) × N(t) ‖ = ‖ T(t) ‖ ‖ N(t) ‖ sinθ,
where θ is the angle between T(t) and N(t). Since N(t) is the derivative of a unit vector, property (vii) of the derivative

of a vector-valued function tells us that T(t) and N(t) are orthogonal to each other, so θ = π/2. Furthermore, they are

both unit vectors, so their magnitude is 1. Therefore, ‖ T(t) ‖ ‖ N(t) ‖ sinθ = (1)(1)sin(π/2) = 1 and B(t) is a unit
vector.
The principal unit normal vector can be challenging to calculate because the unit tangent vector involves a quotient, and
this quotient often has a square root in the denominator. In the three-dimensional case, finding the cross product of the unit
tangent vector and the unit normal vector can be even more cumbersome. Fortunately, we have alternative formulas for
finding these two vectors, and they are presented in Motion in Space.

Example 3.12
Finding the Principal Unit Normal Vector and Binormal Vector
For each of the following vector-valued functions, find the principal unit normal vector. Then, if possible, find
the binormal vector.
a.

r(t) = 4cost i − 4sint j

b.

r(t) = (6t + 2) i + 5t 2 j − 8t k

Solution
a. This function describes a circle.

To find the principal unit normal vector, we first must find the unit tangent vector T(t):

all values of t:

T(t) · N(t) = 〈 −sint, − cost 〉 · 〈 −cost, sint 〉
= sint cost − cost sint
= 0.
Furthermore, the principal unit normal vector points toward the center of the circle from every point on
the circle. Since r(t) defines a curve in two dimensions, we cannot calculate the binormal vector.

Find the unit normal vector for the vector-valued function r(t) = ⎛⎝t 2 − 3t⎞⎠ i + (4t + 1) j and evaluate it

at t = 2.
For any smooth curve in three dimensions that is defined by a vector-valued function, we now have formulas for the unit
tangent vector T, the unit normal vector N, and the binormal vector B. The unit normal vector and the binormal vector form
a plane that is perpendicular to the curve at any point on the curve, called the normal plane. In addition, these three vectors
form a frame of reference in three-dimensional space called the Frenet frame of reference (also called the TNB frame)
(Figure 3.7). Lat, the plane determined by the vectors T and N forms the osculating plane of C at any point P on the curve.

Figure 3.7 This figure depicts a Frenet frame of reference. At every point P on a threedimensional curve, the unit tangent, unit normal, and binormal vectors form a threedimensional frame of reference.

Suppose we form a circle in the osculating plane of C at point P on the curve. Assume that the circle has the same curvature

298

Chapter 3 | Vector-Valued Functions

as the curve does at point P and let the circle have radius r. Then, the curvature of the circle is given by 1/r. We call r the
radius of curvature of the curve, and it is equal to the reciprocal of the curvature. If this circle lies on the concave side
of the curve and is tangent to the curve at point P, then this circle is called the osculating circle of C at P, as shown in the
following figure.

Figure 3.8 In this osculating circle, the circle is tangent to curve C at point P and shares the
same curvature.

For more information on osculating circles, see this demonstration (http://www.openstaxcollege.org/
l/20_OsculCircle1) on curvature and torsion, this article (http://www.openstaxcollege.org/l/
20_OsculCircle3) on osculating circles, and this discussion (http://www.openstaxcollege.org/l/
20_OsculCircle2) of Serret formulas.
To find the equation of an osculating circle in two dimensions, we need find only the center and radius of the circle.

This gives κ = 6. Therefore, the radius of the osculating circle is given by R = 1
κ = . Next, we then calculate

the coordinates of the center of the circle. When x = 1, the slope of the tangent line is zero. Therefore, the center
of the osculating circle is directly above the point on the graph with coordinates (1, −1). The center is located

at ⎝1, − 5 ⎠. The formula for a circle with radius r and center (h, k) is given by (x − h) 2 + ⎛⎝y − k⎞⎠ 2 = r 2.

Learning Objectives
3.4.1 Describe the velocity and acceleration vectors of a particle moving in space.
3.4.2 Explain the tangential and normal components of acceleration.
3.4.3 State Kepler’s laws of planetary motion.
We have now seen how to describe curves in the plane and in space, and how to determine their properties, such as arc
length and curvature. All of this leads to the main goal of this chapter, which is the description of motion along plane curves
and space curves. We now have all the tools we need; in this section, we put these ideas together and look at how to use
them.

Motion Vectors in the Plane and in Space
Our starting point is using vector-valued functions to represent the position of an object as a function of time. All of the
following material can be applied either to curves in the plane or to space curves. For example, when we look at the orbit of
the planets, the curves defining these orbits all lie in a plane because they are elliptical. However, a particle traveling along
a helix moves on a curve in three dimensions.

Definition
Let r(t) be a twice-differentiable vector-valued function of the parameter t that represents the position of an object as
a function of time. The velocity vector v(t) of the object is given by

Velocity = v(t) = r′(t).

(3.20)

The acceleration vector a(t) is defined to be

Acceleration = a(t) = v′(t) = r″(t).

(3.21)

Speed = v(t) = ‖ v(t) ‖ = ‖ r′(t) ‖ = ds .
dt

(3.22)

The speed is defined to be

Since r(t) can be in either two or three dimensions, these vector-valued functions can have either two or three components.

In two dimensions, we define r(t) = x(t)i + y(t) j and in three dimensions r(t) = x(t)i + y(t) j + z(t)k. Then the velocity,
acceleration, and speed can be written as shown in the following table.

To gain a better understanding of the velocity and acceleration vectors, imagine you are driving along a curvy road. If you
do not turn the steering wheel, you would continue in a straight line and run off the road. The speed at which you are
traveling when you run off the road, coupled with the direction, gives a vector representing your velocity, as illustrated in
the following figure.

Figure 3.12 At each point along a road traveled by a car, the velocity vector of the car is
tangent to the path traveled by the car.

However, the fact that you must turn the steering wheel to stay on the road indicates that your velocity is always changing
(even if your speed is not) because your direction is constantly changing to keep you on the road. As you turn to the right,
your acceleration vector also points to the right. As you turn to the left, your acceleration vector points to the left. This
indicates that your velocity and acceleration vectors are constantly changing, regardless of whether your actual speed varies
(Figure 3.13).

308

Chapter 3 | Vector-Valued Functions

Figure 3.13 The dashed line represents the trajectory of an object (a
car, for example). The acceleration vector points toward the inside of the
turn at all times.

Components of the Acceleration Vector
We can combine some of the concepts discussed in Arc Length and Curvature with the acceleration vector to gain a
deeper understanding of how this vector relates to motion in the plane and in space. Recall that the unit tangent vector T
and the unit normal vector N form an osculating plane at any point P on the curve defined by a vector-valued function r(t).

The following theorem shows that the acceleration vector a(t) lies in the osculating plane and can be written as a linear
combination of the unit tangent and the unit normal vectors.

Theorem 3.7: The Plane of the Acceleration Vector
The acceleration vector a(t) of an object moving along a curve traced out by a twice-differentiable function r(t) lies
in the plane formed by the unit tangent vector T(t) and the principal unit normal vector N(t) to C. Furthermore,

a(t) = v′ (t)T(t) + ⎡⎣v(t)⎤⎦ 2 κ N(t).
Here, v(t) is the speed of the object and κ is the curvature of C traced out by r(t).

Proof
Because v(t) = r′(t) and T(t) =

r′(t)
, we have v(t) = ‖ r′(t) ‖ T(t) = v(t)T(t). Now we differentiate this
‖ r′(t) ‖

equation:

a(t) = v′(t) = d ⎛⎝v(t)T(t)⎞⎠ = v′ (t)T(t) + v(t)T′(t).
dt
Since N(t) =

T′(t)
, we know T′(t) = ‖ T′(t) ‖ N(t), so
‖ T′(t) ‖
a(t) = v′ (t)T(t) + v(t) ‖ T′(t) ‖ N(t).

A

formula

for

curvature

is

κ=

‖ T′(t) ‖
,
‖ r′(t) ‖

so

‖ T′(t) ‖ = κ ‖ r′(t) ‖ = κv(t).

This

gives

a(t) = v′ (t)T(t) + κ⎛⎝v(t)⎞⎠ 2 N(t).
□
The coefficients of T(t) and N(t) are referred to as the tangential component of acceleration and the normal component

Chapter 3 | Vector-Valued Functions

309

of acceleration, respectively. We write a T to denote the tangential component and a N to denote the normal component.

Theorem 3.8: Tangential and Normal Components of Acceleration
Let r(t) be a vector-valued function that denotes the position of an object as a function of time. Then a(t) = r″(t) is
the acceleration vector. The tangential and normal components of acceleration a T and a N are given by the formulas

aT = a · T = v · a
‖v‖

(3.23)

‖ v×a ‖
=
‖v‖

(3.24)

and

aN = a · N =

‖ a ‖ 2 − a 2T.

These components are related by the formula

a(t) = a T T(t) + a N N(t).

(3.25)

Here T(t) is the unit tangent vector to the curve defined by r(t), and N(t) is the unit normal vector to the curve
defined by r(t).

The normal component of acceleration is also called the centripetal component of acceleration or sometimes the radial
component of acceleration. To understand centripetal acceleration, suppose you are traveling in a car on a circular track at
a constant speed. Then, as we saw earlier, the acceleration vector points toward the center of the track at all times. As a
rider in the car, you feel a pull toward the outside of the track because you are constantly turning. This sensation acts in the
opposite direction of centripetal acceleration. The same holds true for noncircular paths. The reason is that your body tends
to travel in a straight line and resists the force resulting from acceleration that push it toward the side. Note that at point B in
Figure 3.14 the acceleration vector is pointing backward. This is because the car is decelerating as it goes into the curve.

Figure 3.14 The tangential and normal components of acceleration can be used to
describe the acceleration vector.

The tangential and normal unit vectors at any given point on the curve provide a frame of reference at that point. The
tangential and normal components of acceleration are the projections of the acceleration vector onto T and N, respectively.

Example 3.15
Finding Components of Acceleration

An object moves in a path defined by the vector-valued function r(t) = 4t i + t 2 j, where t measures

time in seconds.
a. Find a T and a N as functions of t.
b. Find a T and a N at time t = −3.

Projectile Motion
Now let’s look at an application of vector functions. In particular, let’s consider the effect of gravity on the motion of an
object as it travels through the air, and how it determines the resulting trajectory of that object. In the following, we ignore
the effect of air resistance. This situation, with an object moving with an initial velocity but with no forces acting on it other
than gravity, is known as projectile motion. It describes the motion of objects from golf balls to baseballs, and from arrows
to cannonballs.
First we need to choose a coordinate system. If we are standing at the origin of this coordinate system, then we choose the
positive y-axis to be up, the negative y-axis to be down, and the positive x-axis to be forward (i.e., away from the thrower
of the object). The effect of gravity is in a downward direction, so Newton’s second law tells us that the force on the object
resulting from gravity is equal to the mass of the object times the acceleration resulting from to gravity, or F g = mg,
where F g represents the force from gravity and g represents the acceleration resulting from gravity at Earth’s surface.
The value of g in the English system of measurement is approximately 32 ft/sec2 and it is approximately 9.8 m/sec2 in the
metric system. This is the only force acting on the object. Since gravity acts in a downward direction, we can write the force
resulting from gravity in the form F g = −mg j, as shown in the following figure.

Figure 3.15 An object is falling under the influence of
gravity.

Visit this website (http://www.openstaxcollege.org/l/20_projectile) for a video showing projectile motion.

Newton’s second law also tells us that F = ma, where a represents the acceleration vector of the object. This force must
be equal to the force of gravity at all times, so we therefore know that

F = Fg
ma = −mg j
a = −g j.
Now we use the fact that the acceleration vector is the first derivative of the velocity vector. Therefore, we can rewrite the
last equation in the form

312

Chapter 3 | Vector-Valued Functions

v′(t) = −g j.
By taking the antiderivative of each side of this equation we obtain

v(t) = ∫ −g jdt

= −gt j + C 1

for some constant vector C 1. To determine the value of this vector, we can use the velocity of the object at a fixed time, say
at time t = 0. We call this velocity the initial velocity: v(0) = v 0. Therefore, v(0) = −g(0) j + C 1 = v 0 and C 1 = v 0.
This gives the velocity vector as v(t) = −gt j + v 0.

Next we use the fact that velocity v(t) is the derivative of position s(t). This gives the equation

s′(t) = −gt j + v 0.
Taking the antiderivative of both sides of this equation leads to

s(t) = ∫ −gt j + v 0 dt

= − 1 gt 2 j + v 0 t + C 2,
2

with another unknown constant vector C 2. To determine the value of C 2,
at a given time, say at time

t = 0.

we can use the position of the object

We call this position the initial position:

s(0) = s 0.

Therefore,

s(0) = −(1/2)g(0) 2 j + v 0 (0) + C 2 = s 0 and C 2 = s 0. This gives the position of the object at any time as
s(t) = − 1 gt 2 j + v 0 t + s 0.
2
Let’s take a closer look at the initial velocity and initial position. In particular, suppose the object is thrown upward from the
origin at an angle θ to the horizontal, with initial speed v 0. How can we modify the previous result to reflect this scenario?
First, we can assume it is thrown from the origin. If not, then we can move the origin to the point from where it is thrown.
Therefore, s 0 = 0, as shown in the following figure.

Figure 3.16 Projectile motion when the object is thrown upward at an angle θ.
The horizontal motion is at constant velocity and the vertical motion is at constant
acceleration.

We can rewrite the initial velocity vector in the form v 0 = v 0 cosθ i + v 0 sinθ j. Then the equation for the position function

s(t) becomes

The coefficient of i represents the horizontal component of s(t) and is the horizontal distance of the object from the origin
at time t. The maximum value of the horizontal distance (measured at the same initial and final altitude) is called the range
R. The coefficient of j represents the vertical component of s(t) and is the altitude of the object at time t. The maximum
value of the vertical distance is the height H.

Example 3.16
Motion of a Cannonball
During an Independence Day celebration, a cannonball is fired from a cannon on a cliff toward the water. The
cannon is aimed at an angle of 30° above horizontal and the initial speed of the cannonball is 600 ft/sec. The
cliff is 100 ft above the water (Figure 3.17).
a. Find the maximum height of the cannonball.
b. How long will it take for the cannonball to splash into the sea?
c. How far out to sea will the cannonball hit the water?

Figure 3.17 The flight of a cannonball (ignoring air resistance) is projectile motion.

Solution
We use the equation

⎛

⎞

s(t) = v 0 t cosθ i + ⎝v 0 t sinθ − 1 gt 2⎠ j
2
with θ = 30°,

g = 32 ft/sec 2, and v 0 = 600 ft/sec. Then the position equation becomes
⎛

⎞

s(t) = 600t(cos30)i + ⎝600t sin30 − 1 (32)t 2⎠ j
2
= 300t 3i + ⎛⎝300t − 16t 2⎞⎠ j.
a. The cannonball reaches its maximum height when the vertical component of its velocity is zero, because

314

Chapter 3 | Vector-Valued Functions

the cannonball is neither rising nor falling at that point. The velocity vector is

v(t) = s′(t)
= 300 3i + (300 − 32t) j.
Therefore, the vertical component of velocity is given by the expression 300 − 32t. Setting this
expression equal to zero and solving for t gives t = 9.375 sec. The height of the cannonball at this time
is given by the vertical component of the position vector, evaluated at t = 9.375.

s(9.375) = 300(9.375) 3i + ⎛⎝300(9.375) − 16(9.375) 2⎞⎠ j
= 4871.39i + 1406.25j
Therefore, the maximum height of the cannonball is 1406.39 ft above the cannon, or 1506.39 ft above sea
level.
b. When the cannonball lands in the water, it is 100 ft below the cannon. Therefore, the vertical component
of the position vector is equal to −100. Setting the vertical component of s(t) equal to −100 and
solving, we obtain

300t − 16t 2 = −100
16t − 300t − 100 = 0
4t 2 − 75t − 25 = 0

8
The positive value of t that solves this equation is approximately 19.08. Therefore, the cannonball hits the
water after approximately 19.08 sec.
c. To find the distance out to sea, we simply substitute the answer from part (b) into s(t):

s(19.08) = 300(19.08) 3i + ⎛⎝300(19.08) − 16(19.08) 2⎞⎠ j
= 9914.26i − 100.7424 j.
Therefore, the ball hits the water about 9914.26 ft away from the base of the cliff. Notice that the vertical
component of the position vector is very close to −100, which tells us that the ball just hit the water.
Note that 9914.26 feet is not the true range of the cannon since the cannonball lands in the ocean at a
location below the cannon. The range of the cannon would be determined by finding how far out the
cannonball is when its height is 100 ft above the water (the same as the altitude of the cannon).

3.16 An archer fires an arrow at an angle of 40° above the horizontal with an initial speed of 98 m/sec. The
height of the archer is 171.5 cm. Find the horizontal distance the arrow travels before it hits the ground.

One final question remains: In general, what is the maximum distance a projectile can travel, given its initial speed? To
determine this distance, we assume the projectile is fired from ground level and we wish it to return to ground level. In other
words, we want to determine an equation for the range. In this case, the equation of projectile motion is

Therefore, the range for an angle of 45° is v 20/g.

Kepler’s Laws
During the early 1600s, Johannes Kepler was able to use the amazingly accurate data from his mentor Tycho Brahe to
formulate his three laws of planetary motion, now known as Kepler’s laws of planetary motion. These laws also apply to
other objects in the solar system in orbit around the Sun, such as comets (e.g., Halley’s comet) and asteroids. Variations of
these laws apply to satellites in orbit around Earth.

Theorem 3.9: Kepler’s Laws of Planetary Motion
i. The path of any planet about the Sun is elliptical in shape, with the center of the Sun located at one focus of
the ellipse (the law of ellipses).
ii. A line drawn from the center of the Sun to the center of a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal time intervals

316

Chapter 3 | Vector-Valued Functions

(the law of equal areas) (Figure 3.18).
iii. The ratio of the squares of the periods of any two planets is equal to the ratio of the cubes of the lengths of
their semimajor orbital axes (the law of harmonies).

Figure 3.18 Kepler’s first and second laws are pictured here.
The Sun is located at a focus of the elliptical orbit of any planet.
Furthermore, the shaded areas are all equal, assuming that the
amount of time measured as the planet moves is the same for
each region.

Kepler’s third law is especially useful when using appropriate units. In particular, 1 astronomical unit is defined to be the
average distance from Earth to the Sun, and is now recognized to be 149,597,870,700 m or, approximately 93,000,000 mi.
We therefore write 1 A.U. = 93,000,000 mi. Since the time it takes for Earth to orbit the Sun is 1 year, we use Earth years
for units of time. Then, substituting 1 year for the period of Earth and 1 A.U. for the average distance to the Sun, Kepler’s
third law can be written as

T p2 = D 3p
for any planet in the solar system, where T P is the period of that planet measured in Earth years and D P is the average
distance from that planet to the Sun measured in astronomical units. Therefore, if we know the average distance from a
planet to the Sun (in astronomical units), we can then calculate the length of its year (in Earth years), and vice versa.
Kepler’s laws were formulated based on observations from Brahe; however, they were not proved formally until Sir Isaac
Newton was able to apply calculus. Furthermore, Newton was able to generalize Kepler’s third law to other orbital systems,
such as a moon orbiting around a planet. Kepler’s original third law only applies to objects orbiting the Sun.

Proof
Let’s now prove Kepler’s first law using the calculus of vector-valued functions. First we need a coordinate system. Let’s
place the Sun at the origin of the coordinate system and let the vector-valued function r(t) represent the location of a planet
as a function of time. Newton proved Kepler’s law using his second law of motion and his law of universal gravitation.
Newton’s second law of motion can be written as F = ma, where F represents the net force acting on the planet. His law
of universal gravitation can be written in the form F = − GmM2 ·

r , which indicates that the force resulting from

the gravitational attraction of the Sun points back toward the Sun, and has magnitude GmM2 (Figure 3.19).

Figure 3.19 The gravitational force between Earth and the
Sun is equal to the mass of the earth times its acceleration.

Setting these two forces equal to each other, and using the fact that a(t) = v′(t), we obtain

which can be rewritten as

d v = − GM r.

This equation shows that the vectors d v/dt and r are parallel to each other, so d v/dt × r = 0. Next, let’s differentiate
r × v with respect to time:

d (r × v) = d r × v + r × d v = v × v + 0 = 0.
dt
dt
dt
This proves that r × v is a constant vector, which we call C. Since r and v are both perpendicular to C for all values of t,
they must lie in a plane perpendicular to C. Therefore, the motion of the planet lies in a plane.
Next we calculate the expression d v/dt × C:

d v × C = − GM r × (r × v) = − GM ⎡⎣(r · v)r − (r · r)v⎤⎦.

The last equality in Equation 3.26 is from the triple cross product formula (Introduction to Vectors in Space). We

d (r · r) = d r · r + r · d r = 2r · d r = 2r · v.

However, r · (v × C) = (r × v) · C, so

(r × v) · C = GM ‖ r ‖ + r · D.
Since r × v = C, we have

Note that r · D = ‖ r ‖ ‖ D ‖ cosθ, where θ is the angle between r and D. Therefore,

a hyperbola if e > 1, a parabola if e = 1, or an ellipse if e < 1. Since planets have closed orbits, the only possibility is
an ellipse. However, at this point it should be mentioned that hyperbolic comets do exist. These are objects that are merely
passing through the solar system at speeds too great to be trapped into orbit around the Sun. As they pass close enough to
the Sun, the gravitational field of the Sun deflects the trajectory enough so the path becomes hyperbolic.

Example 3.17
Using Kepler’s Third Law for Nonheliocentric Orbits
Kepler’s third law of planetary motion can be modified to the case of one object in orbit around an object other
than the Sun, such as the Moon around the Earth. In this case, Kepler’s third law becomes

P2 =

G(m + M)

(3.30)

where m is the mass of the Moon and M is the mass of Earth, a represents the length of the major axis of the

Given that the mass of the Moon is

the mass of Earth is

G = 6.67 × 10 −11 m /kg · sec 2, and the period of the moon is 27.3 days, let’s find the length of the major axis
of the orbit of the Moon around Earth.

Solution
It is important to be consistent with units. Since the universal gravitational constant contains seconds in the units,
we need to use seconds for the period of the Moon as well:

Example 3.18
Chapter Opener: Halley’s Comet

320

Chapter 3 | Vector-Valued Functions

We now return to the chapter opener, which discusses the motion of Halley’s comet around the Sun. Kepler’s
first law states that Halley’s comet follows an elliptical path around the Sun, with the Sun as one focus of the
ellipse. The period of Halley’s comet is approximately 76.1 years, depending on how closely it passes by Jupiter
and Saturn as it passes through the outer solar system. Let’s use T = 76.1 years. What is the average distance of
Halley’s comet from the Sun?

Solution
Using the equation T 2 = D 3 with T = 76.1, we obtain D 3 = 5791.21, so D ≈ 17.96 A.U. This comes out
to approximately 1.67 × 10 9 mi.
A natural question to ask is: What are the maximum (aphelion) and minimum (perihelion) distances from Halley’s
Comet to the Sun? The eccentricity of the orbit of Halley’s Comet is 0.967 (Source: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/
planetary/factsheet/cometfact.html). Recall that the formula for the eccentricity of an ellipse is e = c/a, where
a is the length of the semimajor axis and c is the distance from the center to either focus. Therefore,
0.967 = c/17.96 and c ≈ 17.37 A.U. Subtracting this from a gives the perihelion distance
p = a − c = 17.96 − 17.37 = 0.59 A.U. According to the National Space Science Data Center (Source:
http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/cometfact.html), the perihelion distance for Halley’s comet is 0.587
A.U. To calculate the aphelion distance, we add

P = a + c = 17.96 + 17.37 = 35.33 A.U.
This is approximately 3.3 × 10 9 mi. The average distance from Pluto to the Sun is 39.5 A.U. (Source:
http://www.oarval.org/furthest.htm), so it would appear that Halley’s Comet stays just within the orbit of Pluto.

Navigating a Banked Turn
How fast can a racecar travel through a circular turn without skidding and hitting the wall? The answer could depend
on several factors:
• The weight of the car;
• The friction between the tires and the road;
• The radius of the circle;
• The “steepness” of the turn.
In this project we investigate this question for NASCAR racecars at the Bristol Motor Speedway in Tennessee. Before
considering this track in particular, we use vector functions to develop the mathematics and physics necessary for
answering questions such as this.
A car of mass m moves with constant angular speed ω around a circular curve of radius R (Figure 3.20). The curve
is banked at an angle θ. If the height of the car off the ground is h, then the position of the car at time t is given by the
function r(t) = 〈 Rcos(ωt), Rsin(ωt), h 〉 .

Figure 3.20 Views of a race car moving around a track.

1. Find the velocity function v(t) of the car. Show that v is tangent to the circular curve. This means that, without
a force to keep the car on the curve, the car will shoot off of it.
2. Show that the speed of the car is ωR. Use this to show that (2π4)/|v| = (2π)/ω.
3. Find the acceleration a. Show that this vector points toward the center of the circle and that |a| = Rω 2.
4. The force required to produce this circular motion is called the centripetal force, and it is denoted Fcent. This
force points toward the center of the circle (not toward the ground). Show that |F cent| = ⎛⎝m|v| 2⎞⎠/R.
As the car moves around the curve, three forces act on it: gravity, the force exerted by the road (this force
is perpendicular to the ground), and the friction force (Figure 3.21). Because describing the frictional force
generated by the tires and the road is complex, we use a standard approximation for the frictional force.
Assume that f = µN for some positive constant µ. The constant µ is called the coefficient of friction.

Chapter 3 | Vector-Valued Functions

Figure 3.21 The car has three forces acting on it: gravity
(denoted by mg), the friction force f, and the force exerted by the
road N.

Let v max denote the maximum speed the car can attain through the curve without skidding. In other words,

v max is the fastest speed at which the car can navigate the turn. When the car is traveling at this speed, the

magnitude of the centripetal force is

|F cent| =

mv 2max
.
R

The next three questions deal with developing a formula that relates the speed v max to the banking angle θ.
5. Show that Ncosθ = mg + f sinθ. Conclude that N = (mg)/⎛⎝cosθ − µ sinθ⎞⎠.
6. The centripetal force is the sum of the forces in the horizontal direction, since the centripetal force points
toward the center of the circular curve. Show that

F cent = Nsinθ + f cosθ.
Conclude that

F cent =

sinθ + µ cosθ
mg.
cosθ − µ sinθ

7. Show that v 2max = ⎛⎝⎛⎝sinθ + µ cosθ⎞⎠/⎛⎝cosθ − µ sinθ⎞⎠⎞⎠gR. Conclude that the maximum speed does not actually
depend on the mass of the car.
Now that we have a formula relating the maximum speed of the car and the banking angle, we are in a position
to answer the questions like the one posed at the beginning of the project.
The Bristol Motor Speedway is a NASCAR short track in Bristol, Tennessee. The track has the approximate
shape shown in Figure 3.22. Each end of the track is approximately semicircular, so when cars make turns
they are traveling along an approximately circular curve. If a car takes the inside track and speeds along the
bottom of turn 1, the car travels along a semicircle of radius approximately 211 ft with a banking angle of
24°. If the car decides to take the outside track and speeds along the top of turn 1, then the car travels along a
semicircle with a banking angle of 28°. (The track has variable angle banking.)

The coefficient of friction for a normal tire in dry conditions is approximately 0.7. Therefore, we assume the coefficient
for a NASCAR tire in dry conditions is approximately 0.98.
Before answering the following questions, note that it is easier to do computations in terms of feet and seconds, and
then convert the answers to miles per hour as a final step.
8. In dry conditions, how fast can the car travel through the bottom of the turn without skidding?
9. In dry conditions, how fast can the car travel through the top of the turn without skidding?
10. In wet conditions, the coefficient of friction can become as low as 0.1. If this is the case, how fast can the car
travel through the bottom of the turn without skidding?
11. Suppose the measured speed of a car going along the outside edge of the turn is 105 mph. Estimate the
coefficient of friction for the car’s tires.

KEY CONCEPTS
3.1 Vector-Valued Functions and Space Curves
• A vector-valued function is a function of the form r(t) = f (t)i + g(t) j or r(t) = f (t)i + g(t) j + h(t)k, where
the component functions f, g, and h are real-valued functions of the parameter t.
• The graph of a vector-valued function of the form r(t) = f (t)i + g(t) j is called a plane curve. The graph of a
vector-valued function of the form r(t) = f (t)i + g(t) j + h(t)k is called a space curve.
• It is possible to represent an arbitrary plane curve by a vector-valued function.
• To calculate the limit of a vector-valued function, calculate the limits of the component functions separately.

3.2 Calculus of Vector-Valued Functions
• To calculate the derivative of a vector-valued function, calculate the derivatives of the component functions, then
put them back into a new vector-valued function.
• Many of the properties of differentiation from the Introduction to Derivatives (http://cnx.org/content/
m53494/latest/) also apply to vector-valued functions.
• The derivative of a vector-valued function r(t) is also a tangent vector to the curve. The unit tangent vector T(t)
is calculated by dividing the derivative of a vector-valued function by its magnitude.
• The antiderivative of a vector-valued function is found by finding the antiderivatives of the component functions,
then putting them back together in a vector-valued function.
• The definite integral of a vector-valued function is found by finding the definite integrals of the component
functions, then putting them back together in a vector-valued function.

3.3 Arc Length and Curvature
• The

arc-length
t

function

for

a

vector-valued

function

is

calculated

using

the

integral

formula

s(t) = ∫ ‖ r′(u) ‖ du. This formula is valid in both two and three dimensions.
a

• The curvature of a curve at a point in either two or three dimensions is defined to be the curvature of the inscribed
circle at that point. The arc-length parameterization is used in the definition of curvature.
• There are several different formulas for curvature. The curvature of a circle is equal to the reciprocal of its radius.
• The principal unit normal vector at t is defined to be

N(t) =

T′(t)
.
‖ T′(t) ‖

330

Chapter 3 | Vector-Valued Functions

• The binormal vector at t is defined as B(t) = T(t) × N(t), where T(t) is the unit tangent vector.
• The Frenet frame of reference is formed by the unit tangent vector, the principal unit normal vector, and the binormal
vector.
• The osculating circle is tangent to a curve at a point and has the same curvature as the tangent curve at that point.

3.4 Motion in Space
• If r(t) represents the position of an object at time t, then r′(t) represents the velocity and r″(t) represents the
acceleration of the object at time t. The magnitude of the velocity vector is speed.
• The acceleration vector always points toward the concave side of the curve defined by r(t). The tangential and
normal components of acceleration a T and a N are the projections of the acceleration vector onto the unit tangent
and unit normal vectors to the curve.
• Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion describe the motion of objects in orbit around the Sun. His third law can be
modified to describe motion of objects in orbit around other celestial objects as well.
• Newton was able to use his law of universal gravitation in conjunction with his second law of motion and calculus
to prove Kepler’s three laws.

Introduction
In Introduction to Applications of Derivatives (http://cnx.org/content/m53602/latest/) , we studied how to
determine the maximum and minimum of a function of one variable over a closed interval. This function might represent
the temperature over a given time interval, the position of a car as a function of time, or the altitude of a jet plane as it travels
from New York to San Francisco. In each of these examples, the function has one independent variable.
Suppose, however, that we have a quantity that depends on more than one variable. For example, temperature can depend
on location and the time of day, or a company’s profit model might depend on the number of units sold and the amount
of money spent on advertising. In this chapter, we look at a company that produces golf balls. We develop a profit model
and, under various restrictions, we find that the optimal level of production and advertising dollars spent determines the
maximum possible profit. Depending on the nature of the restrictions, both the method of solution and the solution itself
changes (see Example 4.41).
When dealing with a function of more than one independent variable, several questions naturally arise. For example, how
do we calculate limits of functions of more than one variable? The definition of derivative we used before involved a limit.
Does the new definition of derivative involve limits as well? Do the rules of differentiation apply in this context? Can we
find relative extrema of functions using derivatives? All these questions are answered in this chapter.

Our first step is to explain what a function of more than one variable is, starting with functions of two independent variables.
This step includes identifying the domain and range of such functions and learning how to graph them. We also examine
ways to relate the graphs of functions in three dimensions to graphs of more familiar planar functions.

Functions of Two Variables
The definition of a function of two variables is very similar to the definition for a function of one variable. The main
difference is that, instead of mapping values of one variable to values of another variable, we map ordered pairs of variables
to another variable.

Definition
A function of two variables z = f ⎛⎝x, y⎞⎠ maps each ordered pair (x, y) in a subset D of the real plane ℝ 2 to a
unique real number z. The set D is called the domain of the function. The range of f is the set of all real numbers

z that has at least one ordered pair (x, y) ∈ D such that f (x, y) = z as shown in the following figure.

Figure 4.2 The domain of a function of two variables consists
of ordered pairs (x, y).

Determining the domain of a function of two variables involves taking into account any domain restrictions that may exist.
Let’s take a look.

Example 4.1
Domains and Ranges for Functions of Two Variables
Find the domain and range of each of the following functions:
a.

f (x, y) = 3x + 5y + 2

b.

g(x, y) = 9 − x 2 − y 2

Solution
a. This is an example of a linear function in two variables. There are no values or combinations of x and

y that cause f (x, y) to be undefined, so the domain of f is ℝ 2. To determine the range, first pick
a value for z. We need to find a solution to the equation f (x, y) = z, or 3x − 5y + 2 = z. One such
solution can be obtained by first setting y = 0, which yields the equation 3x + 2 = z. The solution
⎛

⎞

to this equation is x = z − 2 , which gives the ordered pair ⎝z − 2 , 0⎠ as a solution to the equation

3

3

f (x, y) = z for any value of z. Therefore, the range of the function is all real numbers, or ℝ.
b. For the function g(x, y) to have a real value, the quantity under the square root must be nonnegative:

9 − x 2 − y 2 ≥ 0.
This inequality can be written in the form

x 2 + y 2 ≤ 9.
⎧

|

⎫

Therefore, the domain of g(x, y) is ⎨⎩(x, y) ∈ ℝ 2 x 2 + y 2 ≤ 9⎬⎭. The graph of this set of points can be
described as a disk of radius 3 centered at the origin. The domain includes the boundary circle as shown
in the following graph.

336

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

Figure 4.3 The domain of the function

g(x, y) = 9 − x 2 − y 2 is a closed disk of radius 3.

To determine the range of g(x, y) = 9 − x 2 − y 2 we start with a point (x 0, y 0) on the boundary of the
domain, which is defined by the relation x 2 + y 2 = 9. It follows that x 02 + y 20 = 9 and

g(x 0, y 0) = 9 − x 02 − y 20 = 9 − ⎛⎝x 02 + y 20⎞⎠ = 9 − 9 = 0.
If x 02 + y 20 = 0 (in other words, x 0 = y 0 = 0), then

g(x 0, y 0) = 9 − x 02 − y 20 = 9 − ⎛⎝x 02 + y 20⎞⎠ = 9 − 0 = 3.
This is the maximum value of the function. Given any value c between 0 and 3, we can find an entire
set of points inside the domain of g such that g(x, y) = c:

9 − x2 − y2 = c

9 − x2 − y2 = c2
x 2 + y 2 = 9 − c 2.

Since 9 − c 2 > 0, this describes a circle of radius

9 − c 2 centered at the origin. Any point on this

circle satisfies the equation g(x, y) = c. Therefore, the range of this function can be written in interval
notation as [0, 3].

Graphing Functions of Two Variables
Suppose we wish to graph the function z = (x, y). This function has two independent variables ⎛⎝x and y⎞⎠ and one
dependent variable (z). When graphing a function y = f (x) of one variable, we use the Cartesian plane. We are able to
graph any ordered pair (x, y) in the plane, and every point in the plane has an ordered pair (x, y) associated with it. With a
function of two variables, each ordered pair (x, y) in the domain of the function is mapped to a real number z. Therefore,
the graph of the function f consists of ordered triples (x, y, z). The graph of a function z = (x, y) of two variables is
called a surface.
To understand more completely the concept of plotting a set of ordered triples to obtain a surface in three-dimensional
space, imagine the (x, y) coordinate system laying flat. Then, every point in the domain of the function f has a unique

z-value associated with it. If z is positive, then the graphed point is located above the xy-plane, if z is negative, then the
graphed point is located below the xy-plane. The set of all the graphed points becomes the two-dimensional surface that is
the graph of the function f .

Example 4.2
Graphing Functions of Two Variables
Create a graph of each of the following functions:
a.

g(x, y) = 9 − x 2 − y 2

f (x, y) = x 2 + y 2

z ∈ ℝ 0 ≤ z ≤ 3 . When x + y = 9 we have

g(x, y) = 0. Therefore any point on the circle of radius 3 centered at the origin in the x, y-plane maps
to z = 0 in ℝ 3. If x 2 + y 2 = 8, then g(x, y) = 1, so any point on the circle of radius 2 2 centered
at the origin in the x, y-plane maps to z = 1 in ℝ 3. As x 2 + y 2 gets closer to zero, the value of z
approaches 3. When x 2 + y 2 = 0, then g(x, y) = 3. This is the origin in the x, y-plane. If x 2 + y 2 is
equal to any other value between 0 and 9, then g(x, y) equals some other constant between 0 and 3.
The surface described by this function is a hemisphere centered at the origin with radius 3 as shown in
the following graph.

338

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

Figure 4.4 Graph of the hemisphere represented by the given function of

b. This function also contains the expression x 2 + y 2. Setting this expression equal to various values
starting at zero, we obtain circles of increasing radius. The minimum value of f (x, y) = x 2 + y 2 is
zero (attained when x = y = 0.). When x = 0, the function becomes z = y 2, and when y = 0,
then the function becomes z = x 2. These are cross-sections of the graph, and are parabolas. Recall from
Introduction to Vectors in Space that the name of the graph of f (x, y) = x 2 + y 2 is a paraboloid.
The graph of f appears in the following graph.

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

Figure 4.5 A paraboloid is the graph of the given function of two
variables.

Example 4.3
Nuts and Bolts
A profit function for a hardware manufacturer is given by

f (x, y) = 16 − (x − 3) 2 − ⎛⎝y − 2⎞⎠ 2,
where x is the number of nuts sold per month (measured in thousands) and y represents the number of bolts sold
per month (measured in thousands). Profit is measured in thousands of dollars. Sketch a graph of this function.

Solution
This function is a polynomial function in two variables. The domain of f consists of (x, y) coordinate pairs that
yield a nonnegative profit:

16 − (x − 3) 2 − ⎛⎝y − 2⎞⎠ 2 ≥ 0
(x − 3) 2 + ⎛⎝y − 2⎞⎠ 2 ≤ 16.
This is a disk of radius 4 centered at (3, 2). A further restriction is that both x and y must be nonnegative.
When x = 3 and y = 2,

f (x, y) = 16. Note that it is possible for either value to be a noninteger; for example,

it is possible to sell 2.5 thousand nuts in a month. The domain, therefore, contains thousands of points, so we

339

340

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

can consider all points within the disk. For any z < 16, we can solve the equation f (x, y) = 16:

16 − (x − 3) 2 − ⎛⎝y − 2⎞⎠ 2 = z
(x − 3) 2 + ⎛⎝y − 2⎞⎠ 2 = 16 − z.
Since z < 16, we know that 16 − z > 0, so the previous equation describes a circle with radius

16 − z

centered at the point (3, 2). Therefore. the range of f (x, y) is {z ∈ ℝ|z ≤ 16}. The graph of f (x, y) is also a
paraboloid, and this paraboloid points downward as shown.

Figure 4.6 The graph of the given function of two variables is
also a paraboloid.

Level Curves
If hikers walk along rugged trails, they might use a topographical map that shows how steeply the trails change. A
topographical map contains curved lines called contour lines. Each contour line corresponds to the points on the map that
have equal elevation (Figure 4.7). A level curve of a function of two variables f (x, y) is completely analogous to a
contour line on a topographical map.

perspective photo of Devil’s Tower shows just how steep its sides are. Notice the top of the tower has the same shape as the
center of the topographical map.

Definition
Given a function f (x, y) and a number c in the range of f , a level curve of a function of two variables for the
value c is defined to be the set of points satisfying the equation f (x, y) = c.

Returning to the function g(x, y) = 9 − x 2 − y 2, we can determine the level curves of this function. The range of g is
the closed interval [0, 3]. First, we choose any number in this closed interval—say, c = 2. The level curve corresponding
to c = 2 is described by the equation

9 − x 2 − y 2 = 2.
To simplify, square both sides of this equation:

9 − x 2 − y 2 = 4.
Now, multiply both sides of the equation by −1 and add 9 to each side:

x 2 + y 2 = 5.
This equation describes a circle centered at the origin with radius 5. Using values of c between 0 and 3 yields other
circles also centered at the origin. If c = 3, then the circle has radius 0, so it consists solely of the origin. Figure 4.8
is a graph of the level curves of this function corresponding to c = 0, 1, 2, and 3. Note that in the previous derivation it
may be possible that we introduced extra solutions by squaring both sides. This is not the case here because the range of the
square root function is nonnegative.

Figure 4.8 Level curves of the function

g(x, y) = 9 − x 2 − y 2, using c = 0, 1, 2, and 3 (c = 3
corresponds to the origin).

A graph of the various level curves of a function is called a contour map.

Example 4.4
Making a Contour Map
Given the function f (x, y) = 8 + 8x − 4y − 4x 2 − y 2, find the level curve corresponding to c = 0. Then
create a contour map for this function. What are the domain and range of f ?

Solution
To find the level curve for c = 0, we set f (x, y) = 0 and solve. This gives

0 = 8 + 8x − 4y − 4x 2 − y 2.
We then square both sides and multiply both sides of the equation by −1:

4x 2 + y 2 − 8x + 4y − 8 = 0.
Now, we rearrange the terms, putting the x terms together and the y terms together, and add 8 to each side:

4x 2 − 8x + y 2 + 4y = 8.
Next, we group the pairs of terms containing the same variable in parentheses, and factor 4 from the first pair:

4⎛⎝x 2 − 2x⎞⎠ + ⎛⎝y 2 + 4y⎞⎠ = 8.
Then we complete the square in each pair of parentheses and add the correct value to the right-hand side:

4⎛⎝x 2 − 2x + 1⎞⎠ + ⎛⎝y 2 + 4y + 4⎞⎠ = 8 + 4(1) + 4.
Next, we factor the left-hand side and simplify the right-hand side:

4(x − 1) 2 + ⎛⎝y + 2⎞⎠ 2 = 16.
Last, we divide both sides by 16:

Another useful tool for understanding the graph of a function of two variables is called a vertical trace. Level curves are
always graphed in the xy-plane, but as their name implies, vertical traces are graphed in the xz - or yz-planes.

Definition
Consider a function z = f (x, y) with domain D ⊆ ℝ 2. A vertical trace of the function can be either the set of points
that solves the equation f (a, y) = z for a given constant x = a or f (x, b) = z for a given constant y = b.

Functions of More Than Two Variables
So far, we have examined only functions of two variables. However, it is useful to take a brief look at functions of more
than two variables. Two such examples are

f (x, y, z) = x 2 − 2xy + y 2 + 3yz − z 2 + 4x − 2y + 3x − 6 (a polynomial in three variables)
and

g(x, y, t) = ⎛⎝x 2 − 4xy + y 2⎞⎠sin t − ⎛⎝3x + 5y⎞⎠cos t.
In the first function, (x, y, z) represents a point in space, and the function f maps each point in space to a fourth quantity,
such as temperature or wind speed. In the second function, (x, y) can represent a point in the plane, and t can represent
time. The function might map a point in the plane to a third quantity (for example, pressure) at a given time t. The method
for finding the domain of a function of more than two variables is analogous to the method for functions of one or two
variables.

Functions of two variables have level curves, which are shown as curves in the xy-plane. However, when the function has
three variables, the curves become surfaces, so we can define level surfaces for functions of three variables.

4.2 | Limits and Continuity
Learning Objectives
4.2.1 Calculate the limit of a function of two variables.
4.2.2 Learn how a function of two variables can approach different values at a boundary point,
depending on the path of approach.
4.2.3 State the conditions for continuity of a function of two variables.
4.2.4 Verify the continuity of a function of two variables at a point.
4.2.5 Calculate the limit of a function of three or more variables and verify the continuity of the
function at a point.
We have now examined functions of more than one variable and seen how to graph them. In this section, we see how to take
the limit of a function of more than one variable, and what it means for a function of more than one variable to be continuous
at a point in its domain. It turns out these concepts have aspects that just don’t occur with functions of one variable.

Limit of a Function of Two Variables
Recall from Section 2.2 the definition of a limit of a function of one variable:
Let f (x) be defined for all x ≠ a in an open interval containing a. Let L be a real number. Then

lim f (x) = L

x→a

if for every ε > 0, there exists a δ > 0, such that if 0 < |x − a| < δ for all x in the domain of f , then

| f (x) − L| > ε.
Before we can adapt this definition to define a limit of a function of two variables, we first need to see how to extend the
idea of an open interval in one variable to an open interval in two variables.

Definition
Consider a point (a, b) ∈ ℝ 2. A δ disk centered at point (a, b) is defined to be an open disk of radius δ centered
at point (a, b) —that is,
⎧
⎨
⎩

|

⎫

(x, y) ∈ ℝ 2 (x − a) 2 + (y − b) 2 < δ 2⎬⎭

as shown in the following graph.

Figure 4.14 A δ disk centered around the point (2, 1).

The idea of a δ disk appears in the definition of the limit of a function of two variables. If δ is small, then all the points
(x, y) in the δ disk are close to (a, b). This is completely analogous to x being close to a in the definition of a limit of
a function of one variable. In one dimension, we express this restriction as

a − δ < x < a + δ.

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

353

In more than one dimension, we use a δ disk.

Definition
Let f be a function of two variables, x and y. The limit of f (x, y) as (x, y) approaches (a, b) is L, written

lim

(x, y) → (a, b)

f (x, y) = L

if for each ε > 0 there exists a small enough δ > 0 such that for all points (x, y) in a δ disk around (a, b), except
possibly for (a, b) itself, the value of f (x, y) is no more than ε away from L (Figure 4.15). Using symbols, we
write the following: For any ε > 0, there exists a number δ > 0 such that

| f (x, y) − L| < ε whenever 0 < (x − a) 2 + y − b 2 < δ.
⎛
⎝

⎞
⎠

Figure 4.15 The limit of a function involving two variables requires that f (x, y)
be within ε of L whenever (x, y) is within δ of (a, b). The smaller the value of

ε, the smaller the value of δ.

Proving that a limit exists using the definition of a limit of a function of two variables can be challenging. Instead, we use
the following theorem, which gives us shortcuts to finding limits. The formulas in this theorem are an extension of the
formulas in the limit laws theorem in The Limit Laws (http://cnx.org/content/m53492/latest/) .

Theorem 4.1: Limit laws for functions of two variables
Let f (x, y) and g(x, y) be defined for all (x, y) ≠ (a, b) in a neighborhood around (a, b), and assume the
neighborhood is contained completely inside the domain of f . Assume that L and M are real numbers such
that

lim

(x, y) → (a, b)

f (x, y) = L and

g(x, y) = M, and let c be a constant. Then each of the following

The proofs of these properties are similar to those for the limits of functions of one variable. We can apply these laws to
finding limits of various functions.

6.

lim

Last, use the identity laws on the first six limits and the constant law on the last limit:

lim

⎛ 2
⎞
2
⎝x − 2xy + 3y − 4x + 3y − 6⎠

= (2) 2 − 2(2)(−1) + 3(−1) 2 − 4(2) + 3(−1) − 6

(x, y) → (2, −1)

= −6.
b. Before applying the quotient law, we need to verify that the limit of the denominator is nonzero. Using
the difference law, constant multiple law, and identity law,

lim

⎛
⎝

(x, y) → (2, −1)

4x − 3y⎞⎠ =

lim

4x −

(x, y) → (2, −1)

⎞

(x, y) → (2, −1) ⎠

x − 3⎝

lim

3y

(x, y) → (2, −1)

y

lim

Since the limit of the denominator is nonzero, the quotient law applies. We now calculate the limit of the
numerator using the difference law, constant multiple law, and identity law:

lim

⎛
⎝

(x, y) → (2, −1)

2x + 3y⎞⎠ =

lim

2x +

(x, y) → (2, −1)

⎛

= 2⎝

⎞

(x, y) → (2, −1) ⎠

lim

= 2(2) + 3(−1)
= 1.
Therefore, according to the quotient law we have

Since we are taking the limit of a function of two variables, the point (a, b) is in ℝ 2, and it is possible to approach this
point from an infinite number of directions. Sometimes when calculating a limit, the answer varies depending on the path
taken toward (a, b). If this is the case, then the limit fails to exist. In other words, the limit must be unique, regardless of
path taken.

Example 4.9
Limits That Fail to Exist
Show that neither of the following limits exist:
a.

lim

2xy

(x, y) → (0, 0) 3x 2 + y 2

4xy 2
(x, y) → (0, 0) x 2 + 3y 4
lim

Solution
a. The domain of the function f (x, y) =

2xy
consists of all points in the xy-plane except for the
3x 2 + y 2

point (0, 0) (Figure 4.16). To show that the limit does not exist as (x, y) approaches (0, 0), we note
that it is impossible to satisfy the definition of a limit of a function of two variables because of the fact
that the function takes different values along different lines passing through point (0, 0). First, consider
the line y = 0 in the xy-plane. Substituting y = 0 into f (x, y) gives

f (x, 0) =

2x(0)
=0
3x 2 + 0 2

for any value of x. Therefore the value of f remains constant for any point on the x-axis, and as y
approaches zero, the function remains fixed at zero.
Next, consider the line y = x. Substituting y = x into f (x, y) gives

f (x, x) =

2
2x(x)
= 2x 2 = 1 .
2
2
2
3x + x
4x

This is true for any point on the line y = x. If we let x approach zero while staying on this line, the

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

357

value of the function remains fixed at 1 , regardless of how small x is.

2

Choose a value for ε that is less than 1/2 —say, 1/4. Then, no matter how small a δ disk we
draw around (0, 0), the values of f (x, y) for points inside that δ disk will include both 0 and 1 .

2

Therefore, the definition of limit at a point is never satisfied and the limit fails to exist.

Figure 4.16 Graph of the function

f (x, y) = ⎛⎝2xy⎞⎠/⎛⎝3x 2 + y 2⎞⎠. Along the line y = 0, the

function is equal to zero; along the line y = x, the function is
equal to 1 .

2

In a similar fashion to a., we can approach the origin along any straight line passing through the origin. If
we try the x-axis (i.e., y = 0), then the function remains fixed at zero. The same is true for the y-axis.
Suppose we approach the origin along a straight line of slope k. The equation of this line is y = kx.
Then the limit becomes

4xy 2
4x(kx) 2

(x, y) → (0, 0) x 2 + 3y 4

regardless of the value of k. It would seem that the limit is equal to zero. What if we chose a curve
passing through the origin instead? For example, we can consider the parabola given by the equation
x = y 2. Substituting y 2 in place of x in f (x, y) gives

Interior Points and Boundary Points
To study continuity and differentiability of a function of two or more variables, we first need to learn some new terminology.

Definition
Let S be a subset of ℝ 2 (Figure 4.17).
1. A point P 0 is called an interior point of S if there is a δ disk centered around P 0 contained completely in

S.

2. A point P 0 is called a boundary point of S if every δ disk centered around P 0 contains points both inside
and outside S.

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

359

Figure 4.17 In the set S shown, (−1, 1) is an interior point
and (2, 3) is a boundary point.

Definition
Let S be a subset of ℝ 2 (Figure 4.17).
1.

S is called an open set if every point of S is an interior point.

2.

S is called a closed set if it contains all its boundary points.

An example of an open set is a δ disk. If we include the boundary of the disk, then it becomes a closed set. A set that
contains some, but not all, of its boundary points is neither open nor closed. For example if we include half the boundary of
a δ disk but not the other half, then the set is neither open nor closed.

Definition
Let S be a subset of ℝ 2 (Figure 4.17).
1. An open set S is a connected set if it cannot be represented as the union of two or more disjoint, nonempty
open subsets.
2. A set S is a region if it is open, connected, and nonempty.
The definition of a limit of a function of two variables requires the δ disk to be contained inside the domain of the function.
However, if we wish to find the limit of a function at a boundary point of the domain, the δ disk is not contained inside
the domain. By definition, some of the points of the δ disk are inside the domain and some are outside. Therefore, we need
only consider points that are inside both the δ disk and the domain of the function. This leads to the definition of the limit
of a function at a boundary point.

Definition
Let f be a function of two variables, x and y, and suppose (a, b) is on the boundary of the domain of f . Then,
the limit of f (x, y) as (x, y) approaches (a, b) is L, written

lim

(x, y) → (a, b)

f (x, y) = L,

360

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

if for any ε > 0, there exists a number δ > 0 such that for any point (x, y) inside the domain of f and within a
suitably small distance positive δ of (a, b), the value of f (x, y) is no more than ε away from L (Figure 4.15).
Using symbols, we can write: For any ε > 0, there exists a number δ > 0 such that

| f (x, y) − L| < ε whenever 0 < (x − a) 2 + y − b 2 < δ.

Continuity of Functions of Two Variables
In Continuity (http://cnx.org/content/m53489/latest/) , we defined the continuity of a function of one variable and
saw how it relied on the limit of a function of one variable. In particular, three conditions are necessary for f (x) to be
continuous at point x = a:

f (a) exists.

1.

lim f (x) exists.

2.

x→a

lim f (x) = f (a).

3.

These three conditions are necessary for continuity of a function of two variables as well.

Solution
There are three conditions to be satisfied, per the definition of continuity. In this example, a = 5 and b = −3.
1.

f (a, b) exists. This is true because the domain of the function f consists of those ordered pairs
for which the denominator is nonzero (i.e., x + y + 1 ≠ 0). Point (5, −3) satisfies this condition.
Furthermore,

f (a, b) = f (5, −3) =

f (x, y) = f (a, b). This is true because we have just shown that both sides of this equation

equal three.

4.9

Show that the function f (x, y) = 26 − 2x 2 − y 2 is continuous at point (2, −3).

Continuity of a function of any number of variables can also be defined in terms of delta and epsilon. A function of two
variables is continuous at a point (x 0, y 0) in its domain if for every ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that, whenever

(x − x 0) 2 + (y − y 0) 2 < δ it is true, | f (x, y) − f (a, b)| < ε. This definition can be combined with the formal definition

(that is, the epsilon–delta definition) of continuity of a function of one variable to prove the following theorems:

Theorem 4.2: The Sum of Continuous Functions Is Continuous
If f (x, y) is continuous at (x 0, y 0), and g(x, y) is continuous at (x 0, y 0), then f (x, y) + g(x, y) is continuous
at (x 0, y 0).

Theorem 4.3: The Product of Continuous Functions Is Continuous

Theorem 4.4: The Composition of Continuous Functions Is Continuous
Let g be a function of two variables from a domain D ⊆ ℝ 2 to a range R ⊆ ℝ. Suppose g is continuous at some
point (x 0, y 0) ∈ D and define z 0 = g(x 0, y 0). Let f be a function that maps ℝ to ℝ such that z 0 is in the domain
of f . Last, assume f is continuous at z 0. Then f ∘ g is continuous at (x 0, y 0) as shown in the following figure.

Figure 4.20 The composition of two continuous functions is continuous.

Let’s now use the previous theorems to show continuity of functions in the following examples.

Example 4.12
More Examples of Continuity of a Function of Two Variables
Show that the functions f (x, y) = 4x 3 y 2 and g(x, y) = cos⎛⎝4x 3 y 2⎞⎠ are continuous everywhere.

Solution
The polynomials g(x) = 4x 3 and h(y) = y 2 are continuous at every real number, and therefore by the product
of continuous functions theorem, f (x, y) = 4x 3 y 2 is continuous at every point (x, y) in the xy-plane. Since

f (x, y) = 4x 3 y 2 is continuous at every point (x, y) in the xy-plane and g(x) = cos x is continuous at every

real number x, the continuity of the composition of functions tells us that g(x, y) = cos⎛⎝4x 3 y 2⎞⎠ is continuous
at every point (x, y) in the xy-plane.

Show that the functions f (x, y) = 2x 2 y 3 + 3 and g(x, y) = ⎛⎝2x 2 y 3 + 3⎞⎠ are continuous everywhere.

Functions of Three or More Variables
The limit of a function of three or more variables occurs readily in applications. For example, suppose we have a
function f (x, y, z) that gives the temperature at a physical location (x, y, z) in three dimensions. Or perhaps a function

g(x, y, z, t) can indicate air pressure at a location (x, y, z) at time t. How can we take a limit at a point in ℝ 3 ? What
does it mean to be continuous at a point in four dimensions?
The answers to these questions rely on extending the concept of a δ disk into more than two dimensions. Then, the ideas of
the limit of a function of three or more variables and the continuity of a function of three or more variables are very similar
to the definitions given earlier for a function of two variables.

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

Definition
Let (x 0, y 0, z 0) be a point in ℝ 3. Then, a δ ball in three dimensions consists of all points in ℝ 3 lying at a distance
of less than δ from (x 0, y 0, z 0) —that is,

|

⎧
⎨
⎩

⎫

(x, y, z) ∈ ℝ 3 (x − x 0) 2 + (y − y 0) 2 + (z − z 0) 2 < δ⎬⎭.

To define a δ ball in higher dimensions, add additional terms under the radical to correspond to each additional
dimension. For example, given a point P = (w 0, x 0, y 0, z 0) in ℝ 4, a δ ball around P can be described by

|

⎧
⎨
⎩

⎫

(w, x, y, z) ∈ ℝ 4 (w − w 0) 2 + (x − x 0) 2 + (y − y 0) 2 + (z − z 0) 2 < δ⎬⎭.

To show that a limit of a function of three variables exists at a point (x 0, y 0, z 0), it suffices to show that for any point in a

δ ball centered at (x 0, y 0, z 0), the value of the function at that point is arbitrarily close to a fixed value (the limit value).

All the limit laws for functions of two variables hold for functions of more than two variables as well.

4.3 | Partial Derivatives
Learning Objectives
4.3.1 Calculate the partial derivatives of a function of two variables.
4.3.2 Calculate the partial derivatives of a function of more than two variables.
4.3.3 Determine the higher-order derivatives of a function of two variables.
4.3.4 Explain the meaning of a partial differential equation and give an example.
Now that we have examined limits and continuity of functions of two variables, we can proceed to study derivatives.
Finding derivatives of functions of two variables is the key concept in this chapter, with as many applications in
mathematics, science, and engineering as differentiation of single-variable functions. However, we have already seen that
limits and continuity of multivariable functions have new issues and require new terminology and ideas to deal with them.
This carries over into differentiation as well.

Derivatives of a Function of Two Variables
When studying derivatives of functions of one variable, we found that one interpretation of the derivative is an instantaneous
rate of change of y as a function of x. Leibniz notation for the derivative is dy/dx, which implies that y is the dependent
variable and x is the independent variable. For a function z = f (x, y) of two variables, x and y are the independent
variables and z is the dependent variable. This raises two questions right away: How do we adapt Leibniz notation for
functions of two variables? Also, what is an interpretation of the derivative? The answer lies in partial derivatives.

Definition
Let f (x, y) be a function of two variables. Then the partial derivative of f with respect to x, written as ∂ f /∂ x,
or f x, is defined as

∂f
f ⎛x + h, y⎞⎠ − f (x, y)
= lim ⎝
.
∂x h → 0
h

(4.12)

The partial derivative of f with respect to y, written as ∂ f /∂ y, or f y, is defined as

∂f
f ⎛x, y + k⎞⎠ − f (x, y)
= lim ⎝
.
∂y k → 0
k

(4.13)

This definition shows two differences already. First, the notation changes, in the sense that we still use a version of Leibniz
notation, but the d in the original notation is replaced with the symbol ∂ . (This rounded “d” is usually called “partial,” so
∂ f /∂ x is spoken as the “partial of f with respect to x.”) This is the first hint that we are dealing with partial derivatives.
Second, we now have two different derivatives we can take, since there are two different independent variables. Depending
on which variable we choose, we can come up with different partial derivatives altogether, and often do.

Example 4.14
Calculating Partial Derivatives from the Definition
Use the definition of the partial derivative as a limit to calculate ∂ f /∂ x and ∂ f /∂ y for the function

f (x, y) = x 2 − 3xy + 2y 2 − 4x + 5y − 12.
Solution

f (x, y) = 4x 2 + 2xy − y 2 + 3x − 2y + 5.
The idea to keep in mind when calculating partial derivatives is to treat all independent variables, other than the variable
with respect to which we are differentiating, as constants. Then proceed to differentiate as with a function of a single
variable. To see why this is true, first fix y and define g(x) = f (x, y) as a function of x. Then

Calculating Partial Derivatives
Calculate ∂ f /∂ x and ∂ f /∂ y for the following functions by holding the opposite variable constant then
differentiating:
a.

f (x, y) = x 2 − 3xy + 2y 2 − 4x + 5y − 12

b.

g(x, y) = sin⎛⎝x 2 y − 2x + 4⎞⎠

Solution
a. To calculate ∂ f /∂ x, treat the variable y as a constant. Then differentiate f (x, y) with respect to x
using the sum, difference, and power rules:

∂f

The derivatives of the third, fifth, and sixth terms are all zero because they do not contain the variable x,
so they are treated as constant terms. The derivative of the second term is equal to the coefficient of x,
which is −3y. Calculating ∂ f /∂ y:

∂f
= ∂ ⎡⎣x 2 − 3xy + 2y 2 − 4x + 5y − 12⎤⎦

These are the same answers obtained in Example 4.14.
b. To calculate ∂ g/∂ x, treat the variable y as a constant. Then differentiate g(x, y) with respect to x using
the chain rule and power rule:

∂g

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

To calculate ∂ g/∂ y, treat the variable x as a constant. Then differentiate g(x, y) with respect to y
using the chain rule and power rule:

Calculate ∂ f /∂ x and ∂ f /∂ y for the function f (x, y) = tan⎛⎝x 3 − 3x 2 y 2 + 2y 4⎞⎠ by holding the

opposite variable constant, then differentiating.
How can we interpret these partial derivatives? Recall that the graph of a function of two variables is a surface in ℝ 3. If
we remove the limit from the definition of the partial derivative with respect to x, the difference quotient remains:

f ⎛⎝x + h, y⎞⎠ − f (x, y)
.
h
This resembles the difference quotient for the derivative of a function of one variable, except for the presence of the y
variable. Figure 4.21 illustrates a surface described by an arbitrary function z = f (x, y).

In Figure 4.21, the value of h is positive. If we graph f (x, y) and f ⎛⎝x + h, y⎞⎠ for an arbitrary point (x, y), then the
slope of the secant line passing through these two points is given by

f ⎛⎝x + h, y⎞⎠ − f (x, y)
.
h
This line is parallel to the x-axis. Therefore, the slope of the secant line represents an average rate of change of the function
f as we travel parallel to the x-axis. As h approaches zero, the slope of the secant line approaches the slope of the tangent
line.

If we choose to change y instead of x by the same incremental value h, then the secant line is parallel to the y-axis and
so is the tangent line. Therefore, ∂ f /∂ x represents the slope of the tangent line passing through the point ⎛⎝x, y, f (x, y)⎞⎠

parallel to the x-axis and ∂ f /∂ y represents the slope of the tangent line passing through the point ⎛⎝x, y, f (x, y)⎞⎠ parallel
to the y-axis. If we wish to find the slope of a tangent line passing through the same point in any other direction, then we
need what are called directional derivatives, which we discuss in Directional Derivatives and the Gradient.
We now return to the idea of contour maps, which we introduced in Functions of Several Variables. We can use a
contour map to estimate partial derivatives of a function g(x, y).

Example 4.16
Partial Derivatives from a Contour Map
Use a contour map to estimate ∂ g/∂ x at the point ⎛⎝ 5, 0⎞⎠ for the function g(x, y) = 9 − x 2 − y 2.

Solution
The following graph represents a contour map for the function g(x, y) = 9 − x 2 − y 2.

Figure 4.22 Contour map for the function

g(x, y) = 9 − x 2 − y 2, using c = 0, 1, 2, and 3
(c = 3 corresponds to the origin).
The inner circle on the contour map corresponds to c = 2 and the next circle out corresponds to c = 1. The first
circle is given by the equation 2 = 9 − x 2 − y 2; the second circle is given by the equation 1 = 9 − x 2 − y 2.
The first equation simplifies to x 2 + y 2 = 5 and the second equation simplifies to x 2 + y 2 = 8. The

x-intercept of the first circle is ⎛⎝ 5, 0⎞⎠ and the x-intercept of the second circle is ⎛⎝2 2, 0⎞⎠. We can estimate

the value of ∂ g/∂ x evaluated at the point ⎛⎝ 5, 0⎞⎠ using the slope formula:

Use a contour map to estimate ∂ f /∂ y at point ⎛⎝0, 2⎞⎠ for the function

f (x, y) = x 2 − y 2.
Compare this with the exact answer.

Functions of More Than Two Variables
Suppose we have a function of three variables, such as w = f (x, y, z). We can calculate partial derivatives of w with
respect to any of the independent variables, simply as extensions of the definitions for partial derivatives of functions of two
variables.

Definition
Let f (x, y, z) be a function of three variables. Then, the partial derivative of f with respect to x, written as ∂ f /∂ x,
or f x, is defined to be

∂f
f ⎛x + h, y, z⎞⎠ − f (x, y, z)
= lim ⎝
.
∂x h → 0
h

(4.14)

The partial derivative of f with respect to y, written as ∂ f /∂ y, or f y, is defined to be

∂f
f ⎛x, y + k, z⎞⎠ − f (x, y, z)
= lim ⎝
.
∂y k → 0

(4.15)

The partial derivative of f with respect to z, written as ∂ f /∂ z, or f z, is defined to be

∂f

m
∂z m → 0

(4.16)

We can calculate a partial derivative of a function of three variables using the same idea we used for a function of two
variables. For example, if we have a function f of x, y, and z, and we wish to calculate ∂ f /∂ x, then we treat the other
two independent variables as if they are constants, then differentiate with respect to x.

Example 4.17
Calculating Partial Derivatives for a Function of Three Variables
Use the limit definition of partial derivatives to calculate ∂ f /∂ x for the function

f (x, y, z) = x 2 − 3xy + 2y 2 − 4xz + 5yz 2 − 12x + 4y − 3z.
Then, find ∂ f /∂ y and ∂ f /∂ z by setting the other two variables constant and differentiating accordingly.

Solution
We first calculate ∂ f /∂ x using Equation 4.14, then we calculate the other two partial derivatives by holding

the remaining variables constant. To use the equation to find ∂ f /∂ x, we first need to calculate f ⎛⎝x + h, y, z⎞⎠:

f ⎛⎝x + h, y, z⎞⎠ = (x + h) 2 − 3(x + h)y + 2y 2 − 4(x + h)z + 5yz 2 − 12(x + h) + 4y − 3z
= x 2 + 2xh + h 2 − 3xy − 3xh + 2y 2 − 4xz − 4hz + 5yz 2 − 12x − 12h + 4y − 3z
and recall that f (x, y, z) = x 2 − 3xy + 2y 2 − 4zx + 5yz 2 − 12x + 4y − 3z. Next, we substitute these two
expressions into the equation:

⎡ x 2 + 2xh + h 2 − 3xy − 3hy + 2y 2 − 4xz − 4hz + 5yz 2 − 12x − 12h + 4y − 3z
∂f

⎞
= lim ⎝2x + h − 3y − 4z − 12⎠
h→0

= 2x − 3y − 4z − 12.
Then we find ∂ f /∂ y by holding x and z constant. Therefore, any term that does not include the variable y
is constant, and its derivative is zero. We can apply the sum, difference, and power rules for functions of one
variable:

Calculate all four second partial derivatives for the function

At this point we should notice that, in both Example 4.19 and the checkpoint, it was true that ∂ 2 f /∂ x∂ y = ∂ 2 f /∂ y∂ x.
Under certain conditions, this is always true. In fact, it is a direct consequence of the following theorem.

Theorem 4.5: Equality of Mixed Partial Derivatives (Clairaut’s Theorem)
Suppose that f (x, y) is defined on an open disk D that contains the point (a, b). If the functions f xy and f yx are
continuous on D, then f xy = f yx.

Clairaut’s theorem guarantees that as long as mixed second-order derivatives are continuous, the order in which we choose
to differentiate the functions (i.e., which variable goes first, then second, and so on) does not matter. It can be extended to
higher-order derivatives as well. The proof of Clairaut’s theorem can be found in most advanced calculus books.
Two other second-order partial derivatives can be calculated for any function f (x, y). The partial derivative f xx is equal
to the partial derivative of f x with respect to x, and f yy is equal to the partial derivative of f y with respect to y.

Partial Differential Equations
In Introduction to Differential Equations (http://cnx.org/content/m53696/latest/) , we studied differential
equations in which the unknown function had one independent variable. A partial differential equation is an equation that
involves an unknown function of more than one independent variable and one or more of its partial derivatives. Examples
of partial differential equations are

u t = c 2 ⎛⎝u xx + u yy⎞⎠

(4.17)

u tt = c 2 ⎛⎝u xx + u yy⎞⎠

(4.18)

u xx + u yy = 0

(4.19)

( heat equation in two dimensions)

( wave equation in two dimensions)

( Laplace’s equation in two dimensions)
In the first two equations, the unknown function u has three independent variables— t, x, and y —and c is an arbitrary
constant. The independent variables x and y are considered to be spatial variables, and the variable t represents time. In
Laplace’s equation, the unknown function u has two independent variables x and y.

∂y
= ∂ ⎡⎣20π sin(3πx)cos⎛⎝4πy⎞⎠cos(10πt)⎤⎦
∂y

u yy =

= −80π 2 sin(3πx)sin⎛⎝4πy⎞⎠cos(10πt).

Next, we substitute each of these into the right-hand side of Equation 4.20 and simplify:

4⎛⎝u xx + u yy⎞⎠ = 4⎛⎝−45π 2 sin(3πx)sin⎛⎝4πy⎞⎠cos(10πt) + − 80π 2 sin(3πx)sin⎛⎝4πy⎞⎠cos(10πt)⎞⎠
= 4⎛⎝−125π 2 sin(3πx)sin⎛⎝4πy⎞⎠cos(10πt)⎞⎠

= −500π 2 sin(3πx)sin⎛⎝4πy⎞⎠cos(10πt)
= u tt.
This verifies the solution.

Since the solution to the two-dimensional heat equation is a function of three variables, it is not easy to create a visual
representation of the solution. We can graph the solution for fixed values of t, which amounts to snapshots of the heat
distributions at fixed times. These snapshots show how the heat is distributed over a two-dimensional surface as time
progresses. The graph of the preceding solution at time t = 0 appears in the following figure. As time progresses, the
extremes level out, approaching zero as t approaches infinity.

Figure 4.23

If we consider the heat equation in one dimension, then it is possible to graph the solution over time. The heat equation in
one dimension becomes

u t = c 2 u xx,
where c 2 represents the thermal diffusivity of the material in question. A solution of this differential equation can be written
in the form
2 2 2

u m (x, t) = e −π m c t sin(mπx)

(4.22)

where m is any positive integer. A graph of this solution using m = 1 appears in Figure 4.24, where the initial
temperature distribution over a wire of length 1 is given by u(x, 0) = sin πx. Notice that as time progresses, the wire
cools off. This is seen because, from left to right, the highest temperature (which occurs in the middle of the wire) decreases
and changes color from red to blue.

During the late 1800s, the scientists of the new field of geology were coming to the conclusion that Earth must be
“millions and millions” of years old. At about the same time, Charles Darwin had published his treatise on evolution.
Darwin’s view was that evolution needed many millions of years to take place, and he made a bold claim that the
Weald chalk fields, where important fossils were found, were the result of 300 million years of erosion.
At that time, eminent physicist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) used an important partial differential equation, known
as the heat diffusion equation, to estimate the age of Earth by determining how long it would take Earth to cool from
molten rock to what we had at that time. His conclusion was a range of 20 to 400 million years, but most likely
about 50 million years. For many decades, the proclamations of this irrefutable icon of science did not sit well with
geologists or with Darwin.
Read Kelvin’s paper (http://www.openstaxcollege.org/l/20_KelEarthAge) on estimating the age of
the Earth.

Kelvin made reasonable assumptions based on what was known in his time, but he also made several assumptions
that turned out to be wrong. One incorrect assumption was that Earth is solid and that the cooling was therefore
via conduction only, hence justifying the use of the diffusion equation. But the most serious error was a forgivable
one—omission of the fact that Earth contains radioactive elements that continually supply heat beneath Earth’s mantle.
The discovery of radioactivity came near the end of Kelvin’s life and he acknowledged that his calculation would have
to be modified.
Kelvin used the simple one-dimensional model applied only to Earth’s outer shell, and derived the age from graphs
and the roughly known temperature gradient near Earth’s surface. Let’s take a look at a more appropriate version of
the diffusion equation in radial coordinates, which has the form

∂ T = K ⎡∂ 2 T + 2 ∂ T ⎤.
⎣ ∂2 r r ∂ r ⎦
∂t

(4.23)

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

Here, T(r, t) is temperature as a function of r (measured from the center of Earth) and time t. K is the heat
conductivity—for molten rock, in this case. The standard method of solving such a partial differential equation is by
separation of variables, where we express the solution as the product of functions containing each variable separately.
In this case, we would write the temperature as

T(r, t) = R(r) f (t).
1. Substitute this form into Equation 4.13 and, noting that f (t) is constant with respect to distance (r) and

R(r) is constant with respect to time (t), show that

1 ∂ f = K ⎡∂ 2 R + 2 ∂ R ⎤.
R⎣ ∂r2 r ∂r ⎦
f ∂t

2. This equation represents the separation of variables we want. The left-hand side is only a function of t and
the right-hand side is only a function of r, and they must be equal for all values of r and t. Therefore, they
both must be equal to a constant. Let’s call that constant −λ 2. (The convenience of this choice is seen on
substitution.) So, we have

1 ∂ f = −λ 2
f ∂t

and

K ⎡∂ 2 R + 2 ∂ R ⎤ = −λ 2.
R⎣ ∂r2 r ∂r ⎦

2

Now, we can verify through direct substitution for each equation that the solutions are f (t) = Ae −λ t and
⎛

⎞

2

R(r) = B⎝sinrαr ⎠ + C⎛⎝ cosr αr ⎞⎠, where α = λ/ K. Note that f (t) = Ae +λn t is also a valid solution, so we
could have chosen +λ 2 for our constant. Can you see why it would not be valid for this case as time increases?
3. Let’s now apply boundary conditions.
a. The temperature must be finite at the center of Earth, r = 0. Which of the two constants, B or C,
must therefore be zero to keep R finite at r = 0 ? (Recall that sin(αr)/r → α = as r → 0, but

cos(αr)/r behaves very differently.)
b. Kelvin argued that when magma reaches Earth’s surface, it cools very rapidly. A person can often touch
the surface within weeks of the flow. Therefore, the surface reached a moderate temperature very early
and remained nearly constant at a surface temperature T s. For simplicity, let’s set T = 0 at r = R E
and find α such that this is the temperature there for all time t. (Kelvin took the value to be
300 K ≈ 80°F. We can add this 300 K constant to our solution later.) For this to be true, the sine
argument must be zero at r = R E. Note that α has an infinite series of values that satisfies this
condition. Each value of α represents a valid solution (each with its own value for A). The total or
general solution is the sum of all these solutions.
c. At t = 0, we assume that all of Earth was at an initial hot temperature T 0 (Kelvin took this to be

about 7000 K.) The application of this boundary condition involves the more advanced application of
Fourier coefficients. As noted in part b. each value of α n represents a valid solution, and the general
solution is a sum of all these solutions. This results in a series solution:

⎛T R ⎞ (−1) n − 1 −λn 2 t sin(α n r)
T(r, t) = ⎝ 0π E ⎠∑

, where α n = nπ/R E.

Note how the values of α n come from the boundary condition applied in part b. The term −1 n

is the constant

few terms of this solution shown here and note how λ 2 in the exponential causes the higher terms to decrease quickly
as time progresses:

Near time t = 0, many terms of the solution are needed for accuracy. Inserting values for the conductivity K and

β = π/R E for time approaching merely thousands of years, only the first few terms make a significant contribution.
Kelvin only needed to look at the solution near Earth’s surface (Figure 4.26) and, after a long time, determine what
time best yielded the estimated temperature gradient known during his era (1°F increase per 50 ft). He simply chose
a range of times with a gradient close to this value. In Figure 4.26, the solutions are plotted and scaled, with the
300 − K surface temperature added. Note that the center of Earth would be relatively cool. At the time, it was thought
Earth must be solid.

Epilog
On May 20, 1904, physicist Ernest Rutherford spoke at the Royal Institution to announce a revised calculation that
included the contribution of radioactivity as a source of Earth’s heat. In Rutherford’s own words:
“I came into the room, which was half-dark, and presently spotted Lord Kelvin in the audience, and realised that I was
in for trouble at the last part of my speech dealing with the age of the Earth, where my views conflicted with his. To
my relief, Kelvin fell fast asleep, but as I came to the important point, I saw the old bird sit up, open an eye and cock a
baleful glance at me.
Then a sudden inspiration came, and I said Lord Kelvin had limited the age of the Earth, provided no new source [of
heat] was discovered. That prophetic utterance referred to what we are now considering tonight, radium! Behold! The
old boy beamed upon me.”
Rutherford calculated an age for Earth of about 500 million years. Today’s accepted value of Earth’s age is about 4.6
billion years.

4.4 | Tangent Planes and Linear Approximations
Learning Objectives
4.4.1 Determine the equation of a plane tangent to a given surface at a point.
4.4.2 Use the tangent plane to approximate a function of two variables at a point.
4.4.3 Explain when a function of two variables is differentiable.
4.4.4 Use the total differential to approximate the change in a function of two variables.
In this section, we consider the problem of finding the tangent plane to a surface, which is analogous to finding the equation
of a tangent line to a curve when the curve is defined by the graph of a function of one variable, y = f (x). The slope of the
tangent line at the point x = a is given by m = f ′(a); what is the slope of a tangent plane? We learned about the equation
of a plane in Equations of Lines and Planes in Space; in this section, we see how it can be applied to the problem at
hand.

Tangent Planes
Intuitively, it seems clear that, in a plane, only one line can be tangent to a curve at a point. However, in three-dimensional
space, many lines can be tangent to a given point. If these lines lie in the same plane, they determine the tangent plane at
that point. A tangent plane at a regular point contains all of the lines tangent to that point. A more intuitive way to think of
a tangent plane is to assume the surface is smooth at that point (no corners). Then, a tangent line to the surface at that point
in any direction does not have any abrupt changes in slope because the direction changes smoothly.

Definition
Let P 0 = (x 0, y 0, z 0) be a point on a surface S, and let C be any curve passing through P 0 and lying entirely in

S. If the tangent lines to all such curves C at P 0 lie in the same plane, then this plane is called the tangent plane to
S at P 0 (Figure 4.27).

390

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

Figure 4.27 The tangent plane to a surface S at a point P 0 contains all the tangent lines
to curves in S that pass through P 0.

For a tangent plane to a surface to exist at a point on that surface, it is sufficient for the function that defines the surface to
be differentiable at that point. We define the term tangent plane here and then explore the idea intuitively.

Definition
Let S be a surface defined by a differentiable function z = f (x, y), and let P 0 = (x 0, y 0) be a point in the domain
of f . Then, the equation of the tangent plane to S at P 0 is given by

z = f (x 0, y 0) + f x (x 0, y 0)(x − x 0) + f y (x 0, y 0)(y − y 0).

(4.24)

To see why this formula is correct, let’s first find two tangent lines to the surface S. The equation of the tangent
line to the curve that is represented by the intersection of S with the vertical trace given by x = x 0 is

z = f (x 0, y 0) + f y (x 0, y 0)(y − y 0). Similarly, the equation of the tangent line to the curve that is represented by the

intersection of S with the vertical trace given by y = y 0 is z = f (x 0, y 0) + f x (x 0, y 0)(x − x 0). A parallel vector to the
first tangent line is a = j + f y (x 0, y 0)k; a parallel vector to the second tangent line is b = i + f x (x 0, y 0)k. We can take
the cross product of these two vectors:

This vector is perpendicular to both lines and is therefore perpendicular to the tangent plane. We can use this vector as a
normal vector to the tangent plane, along with the point P 0 = ⎛⎝x 0, y 0, f (x 0, y 0)⎞⎠ in the equation for a plane:
⎛
⎝

n · ⎛⎝(x − x 0)i + (y − y 0)j + ⎛⎝z − f (x 0, y 0)⎞⎠k⎞⎠ = 0

f x (x 0, y 0)(x − x 0) + f y (x 0, y 0)(y − y 0) − ⎛⎝z − f (x 0, y 0)⎞⎠ = 0.

Solving this equation for z gives Equation 4.24.

First, we must calculate f x (x, y) and f y (x, y), then use Equation 4.24 with x 0 = 2 and y 0 = −1:

f x (x, y) = 4x − 3y + 2
f y (x, y) = −3x + 16y − 4
f (2, −1) = 2(2) 2 − 3(2)(−1) + 8(−1) 2 + 2(2) − 4(−1) + 4 = 34.
f x (2, −1) = 4(2) − 3(−1) + 2 = 13
f y (2, −1) = −3(2) + 16(−1) − 4 = −26.
Then Equation 4.24 becomes

z = f (x 0, y 0) + f x (x 0, y 0)(x − x 0) + f y (x 0, y 0)(y − y 0)

z = 34 + 13(x − 2) − 26⎛⎝y − (−1)⎞⎠

If either x = 0 or y = 0, then f (x, y) = 0, so the value of the function does not change on either the x- or y-axis.
Therefore, f x (x, 0) = f y ⎛⎝0, y⎞⎠ = 0,

so as either x or y approach zero, these partial derivatives stay equal to zero.

Substituting them into Equation 4.24 gives z = 0 as the equation of the tangent line. However, if we approach the origin
from a different direction, we get a different story. For example, suppose we approach the origin along the line y = x. If
we put y = x into the original function, it becomes

f (x, x) =

presents a problem. In the definition of tangent plane, we presumed that all tangent lines through point P (in this case, the
origin) lay in the same plane. This is clearly not the case here. When we study differentiable functions, we will see that this
function is not differentiable at the origin.

Linear Approximations
Recall from Linear Approximations and Differentials (http://cnx.org/content/m53605/latest/) that the formula

394

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

for the linear approximation of a function f (x) at the point x = a is given by

y ≈ f (a) + f ′(a)(x − a).
The diagram for the linear approximation of a function of one variable appears in the following graph.

Figure 4.30 Linear approximation of a function in one
variable.

The tangent line can be used as an approximation to the function f (x) for values of x reasonably close to x = a. When
working with a function of two variables, the tangent line is replaced by a tangent plane, but the approximation idea is much
the same.

Definition
Given a function z = f (x, y) with continuous partial derivatives that exist at the point (x 0, y 0),

the linear

approximation of f at the point (x 0, y 0) is given by the equation

L(x, y) = f (x 0, y 0) + f x (x 0, y 0)(x − x 0) + f y (x 0, y 0)(y − y 0).

(4.25)

Notice that this equation also represents the tangent plane to the surface defined by z = f (x, y) at the point (x 0, y 0). The

idea behind using a linear approximation is that, if there is a point (x 0, y 0) at which the precise value of f (x, y) is known,

then for values of (x, y) reasonably close to (x 0, y 0), the linear approximation (i.e., tangent plane) yields a value that
is also reasonably close to the exact value of f (x, y) (Figure 4.31). Furthermore the plane that is used to find the linear
approximation is also the tangent plane to the surface at the point (x 0, y 0).

Example 4.23
Using a Tangent Plane Approximation
Given the function f (x, y) = 41 − 4x 2 − y 2,

approximate f (2.1, 2.9) using point (2, 3) for (x 0, y 0).

What is the approximate value of f (2.1, 2.9) to four decimal places?

Solution
To apply Equation 4.25, we first must calculate f (x 0, y 0),

f x (x 0, y 0), and f y (x 0, y 0) using x 0 = 2 and

y 0 = 3:
f (x 0, y 0) = f (2, 3) = 41 − 4(2) 2 − (3) 2 = 41 − 16 − 9 = 16 = 4

L(x, y) = f (x 0, y 0) + f x (x 0, y 0)(x − x 0) + f y (x 0, y 0)(y − y 0)
= 4 − 2(x − 2) − 3 ⎛⎝y − 3⎞⎠

Last, we substitute x = 2.1 and y = 2.9 into L(x, y):

4
The approximate value of f (2.1, 2.9) to four decimal places is

f (2.1, 2.9) = 41 − 4(2.1) 2 − (2.9) 2 = 14.95 ≈ 3.8665,
which corresponds to a 0.2% error in approximation.

4.20

Given the function f (x, y) = e

5 − 2x + 3y

, approximate f (4.1, 0.9) using point (4, 1) for (x 0, y 0).

What is the approximate value of f (4.1, 0.9) to four decimal places?

Differentiability
When working with a function y = f (x) of one variable, the function is said to be differentiable at a point x = a if f ′ (a)
exists. Furthermore, if a function of one variable is differentiable at a point, the graph is “smooth” at that point (i.e., no
corners exist) and a tangent line is well-defined at that point.
The idea behind differentiability of a function of two variables is connected to the idea of smoothness at that point. In this
case, a surface is considered to be smooth at point P if a tangent plane to the surface exists at that point. If a function is
differentiable at a point, then a tangent plane to the surface exists at that point. Recall the formula for a tangent plane at a
point (x 0, y 0) is given by

z = f (x 0, y 0) + f x (x 0, y 0)(x − x 0) + f y (x 0, y 0)(y − y 0),
For a tangent plane to exist at the point (x 0, y 0), the partial derivatives must therefore exist at that point. However, this is
not a sufficient condition for smoothness, as was illustrated in Figure 4.29. In that case, the partial derivatives existed at
the origin, but the function also had a corner on the graph at the origin.

Definition
A function f (x, y) is differentiable at a point P(x 0, y 0) if, for all points (x, y) in a δ disk around P, we can
write

f (x, y) = f (x 0, y 0) + f x (x 0, y 0)(x − x 0) + f y (x 0, y 0)(y − y 0) + E(x, y),

(4.26)

where the error term E satisfies

lim

(x, y) → (x 0, y 0)

E(x, y)
(x − x 0) 2 + (y − y 0) 2

= 0.

The last term in Equation 4.26 is referred to as the error term and it represents how closely the tangent plane comes to the
surface in a small neighborhood (δ disk) of point P. For the function f to be differentiable at P, the function must be
smooth—that is, the graph of f must be close to the tangent plane for points near P.

Example 4.24
Demonstrating Differentiability
Show that the function f (x, y) = 2x 2 − 4y is differentiable at point (2, −3).

Solution
First, we calculate f (x 0, y 0), f x (x 0, y 0), and f y (x 0, y 0) using x 0 = 2 and y 0 = −3, then we use Equation
4.26:

f (2, −3) = 2(2) 2 − 4(−3) = 8 + 12 = 20
f x (2, −3) = 4(2) = 8
f y (2, −3) = −4.
Therefore m 1 = 8 and m 2 = −4, and Equation 4.26 becomes

f (x, y) = f (2, −3) + f x (2, −3)(x − 2) + f y (2, −3)⎛⎝y + 3⎞⎠ + E(x, y)

2x 2 − 4y = 20 + 8(x − 2) − 4⎛⎝y + 3⎞⎠ + E(x, y)

2x 2 − 4y = 20 + 8x − 16 − 4y − 12 + E(x, y)

2x 2 − 4y = 8x − 4y − 8 + E(x, y)
E(x, y) = 2x 2 − 8x + 8.
Next, we calculate

Depending on the path taken toward the origin, this limit takes different values. Therefore, the limit does not exist and the

Differentiability and continuity for functions of two or more variables are connected, the same as for functions of one
variable. In fact, with some adjustments of notation, the basic theorem is the same.

Theorem 4.6: Differentiability Implies Continuity
Let z = f (x, y) be a function of two variables with (x 0, y 0) in the domain of f . If f (x, y) is differentiable at

(x 0, y 0), then f (x, y) is continuous at (x 0, y 0).

Differentiability Implies Continuity shows that if a function is differentiable at a point, then it is continuous there.
However, if a function is continuous at a point, then it is not necessarily differentiable at that point. For example,

⎧ xy
(x, y) ≠ (0, 0)
f (x, y) = ⎨ x 2 + y 2
⎩0
(x, y) = (0, 0)

is continuous at the origin, but it is not differentiable at the origin. This observation is also similar to the situation in singlevariable calculus.
Continuity of First Partials Implies Differentiability further explores the connection between continuity and
differentiability at a point. This theorem says that if the function and its partial derivatives are continuous at a point, the
function is differentiable.

Theorem 4.7: Continuity of First Partials Implies Differentiability
Let z = f (x, y) be a function of two variables with (x 0, y 0) in the domain of f . If f (x, y),

f x (x, y), and

f y (x, y) all exist in a neighborhood of (x 0, y 0) and are continuous at (x 0, y 0), then f (x, y) is differentiable there.

Recall that earlier we showed that the function

⎧ xy
(x, y) ≠ (0, 0)
f (x, y) = ⎨ x 2 + y 2
⎩0
(x, y) = (0, 0)

was not differentiable at the origin. Let’s calculate the partial derivatives f x and f y :

The contrapositive of the preceding theorem states that if a function is not differentiable, then at least one of the hypotheses
must be false. Let’s explore the condition that f x (0, 0) must be continuous. For this to be true, it must be true that

Differentials
In Linear Approximations and Differentials (http://cnx.org/content/m53605/latest/) we first studied the concept
of differentials. The differential of y, written dy, is defined as f ′ (x)dx. The differential is used to approximate

Δy = f (x + Δx) − f (x), where Δx = dx. Extending this idea to the linear approximation of a function of two variables
at the point (x 0, y 0) yields the formula for the total differential for a function of two variables.

Definition
Let z = f (x, y) be a function of two variables with (x 0, y 0) in the domain of f , and let Δx and Δy be chosen so
that ⎛⎝x 0 + Δx, y 0 + Δy⎞⎠ is also in the domain of f . If f is differentiable at the point (x 0, y 0), then the differentials

dx and dy are defined as

dx = Δx and dy = Δy.
The differential dz, also called the total differential of z = f (x, y) at (x 0, y 0), is defined as

dz = f x (x 0, y 0)dx + f y (x 0, y 0)dy.

(4.27)

Notice that the symbol ∂ is not used to denote the total differential; rather, d appears in front of z. Now, let’s define

Δz = f ⎛⎝x + Δx, y + Δy⎞⎠ − f (x, y). We use dz to approximate Δz, so

Δz ≈ dz = f x (x 0, y 0)dx + f y (x 0, y 0)dy.
Therefore, the differential is used to approximate the change in the function z = f (x 0, y 0) at the point (x 0, y 0) for
given values of Δx and Δy. Since Δz = f ⎛⎝x + Δx, y + Δy⎞⎠ − f (x, y),
⎛
⎝

this can be used further to approximate

⎞
⎠

f x + Δx, y + Δy :
f ⎛⎝x + Δx, y + Δy⎞⎠ = f (x, y) + Δz
≈ f (x, y) + f x (x 0, y 0)Δx + f y (x 0, y 0)Δy.
See the following figure.

Figure 4.33 The linear approximation is calculated via the
formula

f ⎛⎝x + Δx, y + Δy⎞⎠ ≈ f (x, y) + f x (x 0, y 0)Δx + f y (x 0, y 0)Δy.

One such application of this idea is to determine error propagation. For example, if we are manufacturing a gadget and are
off by a certain amount in measuring a given quantity, the differential can be used to estimate the error in the total volume

of the gadget.

Example 4.25
Approximation by Differentials
Find the differential dz of the function f (x, y) = 3x 2 − 2xy + y 2 and use it to approximate Δz at point

(2, −3). Use Δx = 0.1 and Δy = −0.05. What is the exact value of Δz ?
Solution
First, we must calculate f (x 0, y 0), f x (x 0, y 0), and f y (x 0, y 0) using x 0 = 2 and y 0 = −3:

f (x 0, y 0) = f (2, −3) = 3(2) 2 − 2(2)(−3) + (−3) 2 = 12 + 12 + 9 = 33
f x (x, y) = 6x − 2y
f y (x, y) = −2x + 2y
f x (x 0, y 0) = f x (2, −3) = 6(2) − 2(−3) = 12 + 6 = 18
f y (x 0, y 0) = f y (2, −3) = −2(2) + 2(−3) = −4 − 6 = −10.
Then, we substitute these quantities into Equation 4.27:

dz = f x (x 0, y 0)dx + f y (x 0, y 0)dy

dz = 18(0.1) − 10(−0.05) = 1.8 + 0.5 = 2.3.

This is the approximation to Δz = f ⎛⎝x 0 + Δx, y 0 + Δy⎞⎠ − f (x 0, y 0). The exact value of Δz is given by

Δz = f ⎛⎝x 0 + Δx, y 0 + Δy⎞⎠ − f (x 0, y 0)
= f (2 + 0.1, −3 − 0.05) − f (2, −3)
= f (2.1, −3.05) − f (2, −3)
= 2.3425.

4.22

Find the differential dz of the function f (x, y) = 4y 2 + x 2 y − 2xy and use it to approximate Δz at

point (1, −1). Use Δx = 0.03 and Δy = −0.02. What is the exact value of Δz ?

Differentiability of a Function of Three Variables
All of the preceding results for differentiability of functions of two variables can be generalized to functions of three
variables. First, the definition:

Definition
A function f (x, y, z) is differentiable at a point P(x 0, y 0, z 0) if for all points (x, y, z) in a δ disk around P we
can write

f (x, y) = f (x 0, y 0, z 0) + f x (x 0, y 0, z 0)(x − x 0) + f y (x 0, y 0, z 0)(y − y 0)
+ f z (x 0, y 0, z 0)(z − z 0) + E(x, y, z),

where the error term E satisfies

E(x, y, z)

= 0.

If a function of three variables is differentiable at a point (x 0, y 0, z 0), then it is continuous there. Furthermore, continuity
of first partial derivatives at that point guarantees differentiability.

4.5 | The Chain Rule
Learning Objectives
4.5.1 State the chain rules for one or two independent variables.
4.5.2 Use tree diagrams as an aid to understanding the chain rule for several independent and
intermediate variables.
4.5.3 Perform implicit differentiation of a function of two or more variables.
In single-variable calculus, we found that one of the most useful differentiation rules is the chain rule, which allows us to
find the derivative of the composition of two functions. The same thing is true for multivariable calculus, but this time we
have to deal with more than one form of the chain rule. In this section, we study extensions of the chain rule and learn how
to take derivatives of compositions of functions of more than one variable.

Chain Rules for One or Two Independent Variables
Recall that the chain rule for the derivative of a composite of two functions can be written in the form

d ⎛⎝ f ⎛⎝g(x)⎞⎠⎞⎠ = f ′⎛⎝g(x)⎞⎠g′(x).
dx
In this equation, both f (x) and g(x) are functions of one variable. Now suppose that f is a function of two variables and

g is a function of one variable. Or perhaps they are both functions of two variables, or even more. How would we calculate
the derivative in these cases? The following theorem gives us the answer for the case of one independent variable.

Theorem 4.8: Chain Rule for One Independent Variable
Suppose that x = g(t) and y = h(t) are differentiable functions of t and z = f (x, y) is a differentiable function of

x and y. Then z = f ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠ is a differentiable function of t and
dz = ∂ z · dx + ∂ z · dy ,
dt ∂ x dt ∂ y dt

(4.29)

where the ordinary derivatives are evaluated at t and the partial derivatives are evaluated at (x, y).

Proof
The proof of this theorem uses the definition of differentiability of a function of two variables. Suppose that f is
differentiable at the point P(x 0, y 0), where x 0 = g(t 0) and y 0 = h(t 0) for a fixed value of t 0. We wish to prove that

z = f ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠ is differentiable at t = t 0 and that Equation 4.29 holds at that point as well.

Since f is differentiable at P, we know that

z(t) = f (x, y) = f (x 0, y 0) + f x (x 0, y 0)(x − x 0) + f y (x 0, y 0)(y − y 0) + E(x, y),
where

lim

E(x, y)

(x, y) → (x 0, y 0)

(x − x 0) 2 + (y − y 0) 2

(4.30)

= 0. We then subtract z 0 = f (x 0, y 0) from both sides of this equation:

z(t) − z(t 0) = f ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠ − f ⎛⎝x(t 0), y(t 0)⎞⎠

= f x (x 0, y 0)⎛⎝x(t) − x(t 0)⎞⎠ + f y (x 0, y 0)⎛⎝y(t) − y(t 0)⎞⎠ + E⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠.

Next, we divide both sides by t − t 0 :

z(t) − z(t 0)
⎛x(t) − x(t 0) ⎞
⎛y(t) − y(t 0) ⎞ E⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠
t − t 0 = f x (x 0, y 0)⎝ t − t 0 ⎠ + f y (x 0, y 0)⎝ t − t 0 ⎠ + t − t 0 .

Then we take the limit as t approaches t 0 :

Since x(t) and y(t) are both differentiable functions of t, both limits inside the last radical exist. Therefore, this value
is finite. This proves the chain rule at t = t 0; the rest of the theorem follows from the assumption that all functions are
differentiable over their entire domains.
□
Closer examination of Equation 4.29 reveals an interesting pattern. The first term in the equation is
second term is

∂ f dx
·
and the
∂ x dt

∂ f dy
· . Recall that when multiplying fractions, cancelation can be used. If we treat these derivatives
∂ y dt

as fractions, then each product “simplifies” to something resembling ∂ f /dt. The variables x and y that disappear in
this simplification are often called intermediate variables: they are independent variables for the function f , but are
dependent variables for the variable t. Two terms appear on the right-hand side of the formula, and f is a function of two
variables. This pattern works with functions of more than two variables as well, as we see later in this section.

Example 4.26

408

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

Using the Chain Rule
Calculate dz/dt for each of the following functions:
a.

z = f (x, y) = 4x 2 + 3y 2, x = x(t) = sin t, y = y(t) = cos t

b.

z = f (x, y) = x 2 − y 2, x = x(t) = e 2t, y = y(t) = e −t

Solution
a. To use the chain rule, we need four quantities— ∂ z/∂ x, ∂ z/∂ y, dx/dt, and dy/dt:

∂ z = 8x
∂x
dx = cos t
dt

∂ z = 6y
∂y
dy
= −sin t
dt

Now, we substitute each of these into Equation 4.29:

dz = ∂ z · dx + ∂ z · dy
∂ x dt ∂ y dt
dt
= (8x)(cos t) + ⎛⎝6y⎞⎠(−sin t)
= 8x cos t − 6y sin t.
This answer has three variables in it. To reduce it to one variable, use the fact that
x(t) = sin t and y(t) = cos t. We obtain

dz = 8x cos t − 6y sin t
dt
= 8(sin t)cos t − 6(cos t)sin t
= 2 sin t cos t.
This derivative can also be calculated by first substituting x(t) and y(t) into f (x, y),
differentiating with respect to t:

z = f (x, y)
= f ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠

= 4(x(t)) 2 + 3⎛⎝y(t)⎞⎠ 2

= 4sin 2 t + 3cos 2 t.
Then

dz = 2(4 sin t)(cos t) + 2(3 cos t)(−sin t)
dt
= 8 sin t cos t − 6 sin t cos t
= 2 sin t cos t,
which is the same solution. However, it may not always be this easy to differentiate in this form.
b. To use the chain rule, we again need four quantities— ∂ z/∂ x, ∂ z/dy, dx/dt, and dy/dt:

6t
= 2e + 1
2t ⎛ 6t

6t
= 2e + 1 .
e t e 6t − 1

Again, this derivative can also be calculated by first substituting x(t) and y(t) into f (x, y), then
differentiating with respect to t:

z = f (x, y)
= f ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠
= (x(t)) 2 − ⎛⎝y(t)⎞⎠ 2
= e 4t − e −2t

= ⎛⎝e 4t − e −2t⎞⎠

Calculate dz/dt given the following functions. Express the final answer in terms of t.

z = f (x, y) = x 2 − 3xy + 2y 2, x = x(t) = 3 sin 2t, y = y(t) = 4 cos 2t
It is often useful to create a visual representation of Equation 4.29 for the chain rule. This is called a tree diagram for the
chain rule for functions of one variable and it provides a way to remember the formula (Figure 4.34). This diagram can be
expanded for functions of more than one variable, as we shall see very shortly.

Figure 4.34 Tree diagram for the case

dz = ∂ z · dx + ∂ z · dy .
dt ∂ x dt ∂ y dt

In this diagram, the leftmost corner corresponds to z = f (x, y). Since f has two independent variables, there are two lines
coming from this corner. The upper branch corresponds to the variable x and the lower branch corresponds to the variable
y. Since each of these variables is then dependent on one variable t, one branch then comes from x and one branch
comes from y. Last, each of the branches on the far right has a label that represents the path traveled to reach that branch.
The top branch is reached by following the x branch, then the t branch; therefore, it is labeled (∂ z/∂ x) × (dx/dt). The
bottom branch is similar: first the y branch, then the t branch. This branch is labeled ⎛⎝∂ z/∂ y⎞⎠ × ⎛⎝dy/dt⎞⎠. To get the formula

for dz/dt, add all the terms that appear on the rightmost side of the diagram. This gives us Equation 4.29.
In Chain Rule for Two Independent Variables, z = f (x, y) is a function of x and y, and both x = g(u, v) and

y = h(u, v) are functions of the independent variables u and v.
Theorem 4.9: Chain Rule for Two Independent Variables
Suppose x = g(u, v) and y = h(u, v) are differentiable functions of u and v, and z = f (x, y) is a differentiable
function of x and y. Then, z = f ⎛⎝g(u, v), h(u, v)⎞⎠ is a differentiable function of u and v, and

and add the terms that appear at the end of those branches. For the formula for ∂ z/∂ v, follow only the branches that end
with v and add the terms that appear at the end of those branches.
There is an important difference between these two chain rule theorems. In Chain Rule for One Independent Variable,
the left-hand side of the formula for the derivative is not a partial derivative, but in Chain Rule for Two Independent
Variables it is. The reason is that, in Chain Rule for One Independent Variable, z is ultimately a function of t
alone, whereas in Chain Rule for Two Independent Variables, z is a function of both u and v.

Example 4.27
Using the Chain Rule for Two Variables

∂ z = 10x + 2y
∂u
= 10(3u + 2v) + 2(4u − v)

The Generalized Chain Rule
Now that we’ve see how to extend the original chain rule to functions of two variables, it is natural to ask: Can we extend
the rule to more than two variables? The answer is yes, as the generalized chain rule states.

Theorem 4.10: Generalized Chain Rule
Let w = f (x 1, x 2 ,…, x m) be a differentiable function of m independent variables, and for each i ∈ {1,…, m}, let

x i = x i(t 1, t 2 ,…, t n) be a differentiable function of n independent variables. Then
∂ w = ∂ w ∂ x1 + ∂ w ∂ x2 + ⋯ + ∂ w ∂ xm

Calculate ∂ w/∂ u and ∂ w/∂ v given the following functions:

w = f (x, y, z) =

x + 2y − 4z
2x − y + 3z

x = x(u, v) = e 2u cos 3v
y = y(u, v) = e 2u sin 3v

Drawing a Tree Diagram
Create a tree diagram for the case when

w = f (x, y, z), x = x(t, u, v), y = y(t, u, v), z = z(t, u, v)
and write out the formulas for the three partial derivatives of w.

Solution
Starting from the left, the function f has three independent variables: x, y, and z. Therefore, three branches
must be emanating from the first node. Each of these three branches also has three branches, for each of the
variables t, u, and v.

Implicit Differentiation
Recall from Implicit Differentiation (http://cnx.org/content/m53585/latest/) that implicit differentiation provides a
method for finding dy/dx when y is defined implicitly as a function of x. The method involves differentiating both sides
of the equation defining the function with respect to x, then solving for dy/dx. Partial derivatives provide an alternative
to this method.
Consider the ellipse defined by the equation x 2 + 3y 2 + 4y − 4 = 0 as follows.

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

Figure 4.37 Graph of the ellipse defined by

x 2 + 3y 2 + 4y − 4 = 0.

This equation implicitly defines y as a function of x. As such, we can find the derivative dy/dx using the method of
implicit differentiation:

We can also define a function z = f (x, y) by using the left-hand side of the equation defining the ellipse. Then

f (x, y) = x 2 + 3y 2 + 4y − 4. The ellipse x 2 + 3y 2 + 4y − 4 = 0 can then be described by the equation f (x, y) = 0.
Using this function and the following theorem gives us an alternative approach to calculating dy/dx.

Theorem 4.11: Implicit Differentiation of a Function of Two or More Variables
Suppose the function z = f (x, y) defines y implicitly as a function y = g(x) of x via the equation f (x, y) = 0.
Then

∂ f /∂ x
dy
= −
∂ f /∂ y

(4.34)

provided f y (x, y) ≠ 0.
If the equation f (x, y, z) = 0 defines z implicitly as a differentiable function of x and y, then

∂z = − ∂ f /∂ x
∂x
∂ f /∂ z

and

∂z = − ∂ f /∂ y
∂y
∂ f /∂ z

(4.35)

as long as f z (x, y, z) ≠ 0.

Equation 4.34 is a direct consequence of Equation 4.31. In particular, if we assume that y is defined implicitly as a
function of x via the equation f (x, y) = 0, we can apply the chain rule to find dy/dx:

4.6 | Directional Derivatives and the Gradient
Learning Objectives
4.6.1 Determine the directional derivative in a given direction for a function of two variables.
4.6.2 Determine the gradient vector of a given real-valued function.
4.6.3 Explain the significance of the gradient vector with regard to direction of change along a
surface.
4.6.4 Use the gradient to find the tangent to a level curve of a given function.
4.6.5 Calculate directional derivatives and gradients in three dimensions.
In Partial Derivatives we introduced the partial derivative. A function z = f (x, y) has two partial derivatives: ∂ z/∂ x
and ∂ z/∂ y. These derivatives correspond to each of the independent variables and can be interpreted as instantaneous rates
of change (that is, as slopes of a tangent line). For example, ∂ z/∂ x represents the slope of a tangent line passing through
a given point on the surface defined by z = f (x, y), assuming the tangent line is parallel to the x-axis. Similarly, ∂ z/∂ y
represents the slope of the tangent line parallel to the y-axis. Now we consider the possibility of a tangent line parallel to
neither axis.

Directional Derivatives
We start with the graph of a surface defined by the equation z = f (x, y). Given a point (a, b) in the domain of

f , we choose a direction to travel from that point. We measure the direction using an angle θ, which is measured
counterclockwise in the x, y-plane, starting at zero from the positive x-axis (Figure 4.39). The distance we travel is h and
the direction we travel is given by the unit vector u = (cos θ)i + (sin θ)j. Therefore, the z-coordinate of the second point
on the graph is given by z = f (a + h cos θ, b + h sin θ).

Figure 4.39 Finding the directional derivative at a point on the graph of z = f (x, y). The
slope of the black arrow on the graph indicates the value of the directional derivative at that
point.

We can calculate the slope of the secant line by dividing the difference in z-values by the length of the line segment
connecting the two points in the domain. The length of the line segment is h. Therefore, the slope of the secant line is

m sec =

f (a + h cos θ, b + h sin θ) − f (a, b)
.
h

To find the slope of the tangent line in the same direction, we take the limit as h approaches zero.

Definition
Suppose z = f (x, y) is a function of two variables with a domain of D. Let (a, b) ∈ D and define

u = cos θi + sin θj. Then the directional derivative of f in the direction of u is given by

Figure 4.40 Finding the directional derivative in a given direction u at a given point on a surface.
The plane is tangent to the surface at the given point (−1, 2, 15).

Another approach to calculating a directional derivative involves partial derivatives, as outlined in the following theorem.

Theorem 4.12: Directional Derivative of a Function of Two Variables
Let z = f (x, y) be a function of two variables x and y, and assume that f x and f y exist. Then the directional
derivative of f in the direction of u = cos θi + sin θj is given by

D u f (x, y) = f x (x, y)cos θ + f y (x, y)sin θ.

(4.37)

Proof
Equation 4.36 states that the directional derivative of f in the direction of u = cos θi + sin θj is given by

D u f (a, b) = lim

t→0

f (a + t cos θ, b + t sin θ) − f (a, b)
.
t

Let x = a + t cos θ and y = b + t sin θ, and define g(t) = f (x, y). Since f x and f y both exist, we can use the chain
rule for functions of two variables to calculate g′ (t):

∂ f dx ∂ f dy
+
∂ x dt ∂ y dt
= f x (x, y)cos θ + f y (x, y)sin θ.

g′ (t) =

If t = 0, then x = x 0 and y = y 0, so

g′ (0) = f x (x 0, y 0)cos θ + f y (x 0, y 0)sin θ.

426

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

By the definition of g′ (t), it is also true that

g(t) − g(0)
t
f ⎛⎝x 0 + t cos θ, y 0 + t sin θ⎞⎠ − f (x 0, y 0)
= lim
.
t
t→0

g′ (0) = lim

Therefore, D u f (x 0, y 0) = f x (x, y)cos θ + f y (x, y)sin θ.

Solution
First, we must calculate the partial derivatives of f :

f x = 2x − y
f y = −x + 6y,

Gradient
The right-hand side of Equation 4.37 is equal to f x (x, y)cos θ + f y (x, y)sin θ,

which can be written as the dot

product of two vectors. Define the first vector as ∇ f (x, y) = f x (x, y)i + f y (x, y)j and the second vector as

u = (cos θ)i + (sin θ)j. Then the right-hand side of the equation can be written as the dot product of these two vectors:
D u f (x, y) = ∇ f (x, y) · u.

(4.38)

The first vector in Equation 4.38 has a special name: the gradient of the function f . The symbol ∇ is called nabla and
the vector ∇ f is read “del f .”

Definition
Let z = f (x, y) be a function of x and y such that f x and f y exist. The vector ∇ f (x, y) is called the gradient of

f and is defined as
∇ f (x, y) = f x (x, y)i + f y (x, y)j.
The vector ∇ f (x, y) is also written as “grad f .”

Example 4.33
Finding Gradients
Find the gradient ∇ f (x, y) of each of the following functions:
a.

f (x, y) = x 2 − xy + 3y 2

b.

f (x, y) = sin 3x cos 3y

Solution
For both parts a. and b., we first calculate the partial derivatives f x and f y, then use Equation 4.39.
a.

f x (x, y) = 2x − y and f y (x, y) = −x + 6y, so
∇ f (x, y) = f x (x, y)i + f y (x, y)j

= ⎛⎝2x − y⎞⎠i + ⎛⎝−x + 6y⎞⎠j.

b.

f x (x, y) = 3 cos 3x cos 3y and f y (x, y) = −3 sin 3x sin 3y, so
∇ f (x, y) = f x (x, y)i + f y (x, y)j

= ⎛⎝3 cos 3x cos 3y⎞⎠i − ⎛⎝3 sin 3x sin 3y⎞⎠j.

4.29

Find the gradient ∇ f (x, y) of f (x, y) = ⎛⎝x 2 − 3y 2⎞⎠/⎛⎝2x + y⎞⎠.

The gradient has some important properties. We have already seen one formula that uses the gradient: the formula for
the directional derivative. Recall from The Dot Product that if the angle between two vectors a and b is φ, then

a · b = ‖ a ‖ ‖ b ‖ cos φ. Therefore, if the angle between ∇ f (x 0, y 0) and u = (cos θ)i + (sin θ)j is φ, we have
D u f (x 0, y 0) = ∇ f (x 0, y 0) · u = ‖ ∇ f (x 0, y 0) ‖ ‖ u ‖ cos φ = ‖ ∇ f (x 0, y 0) ‖ cos φ.
The ‖ u ‖ disappears because u is a unit vector. Therefore, the directional derivative is equal to the magnitude of the
gradient evaluated at (x 0, y 0) multiplied by cos φ. Recall that cos φ ranges from −1 to 1. If φ = 0, then cos φ = 1

and ∇ f (x 0, y 0) and u both point in the same direction. If φ = π, then cos φ = −1 and ∇ f (x 0, y 0) and u point in
opposite directions. In the first case, the value of D u f (x 0, y 0) is maximized; in the second case, the value of D u f (x 0, y 0)

is minimized. If ∇ f (x 0, y 0) = 0, then D u f (x 0, y 0) = ∇ f (x 0, y 0) · u = 0 for any vector u. These three cases are
outlined in the following theorem.

Theorem 4.13: Properties of the Gradient
Suppose the function z = f (x, y) is differentiable at (x 0, y 0) (Figure 4.41).
i. If ∇ f (x 0, y 0) = 0, then D u f (x 0, y 0) = 0 for any unit vector u.
ii. If ∇ f (x 0, y 0) ≠ 0, then D u f (x 0, y 0) is maximized when u points in the same direction as ∇ f (x 0, y 0).
The maximum value of D u f (x 0, y 0) is ‖ ∇ f (x 0, y 0) ‖ .

iii. If ∇ f (x 0, y 0) ≠ 0,

then D u f (x 0, y 0) is minimized when u points in the opposite direction from

∇ f (x 0, y 0). The minimum value of D u f (x 0, y 0) is − ‖ ∇ f (x 0, y 0) ‖ .

Figure 4.41 The gradient indicates the maximum and minimum values of the
directional derivative at a point.

Example 4.34
Finding a Maximum Directional Derivative
Find the direction for which the directional derivative of f (x, y) = 3x 2 − 4xy + 2y 2 at (−2, 3) is a maximum.
What is the maximum value?

Solution
The maximum value of the directional derivative occurs when ∇ f and the unit vector point in the same direction.
Therefore, we start by calculating ∇ f (x, y):

f x (x, y) = 6x − 4y and f y (x, y) = −4x + 4y, so

∇ f (x, y) = f x (x, y)i + f y (x, y)j = ⎛⎝6x − 4y⎞⎠i + ⎛⎝−4x + 4y⎞⎠j.
Next, we evaluate the gradient at (−2, 3):

∇ f (−2, 3) = ⎛⎝6(−2) − 4(3)⎞⎠i + ⎛⎝−4(−2) + 4(3)⎞⎠ j = −24i + 20j.
We need to find a unit vector that points in the same direction as ∇ f (−2, 3), so the next step is to divide

∇ f (−2, 3) by its magnitude, which is (−24) 2 + (20) 2 = 976 = 4 61. Therefore,
∇ f (−2, 3)
= −24 i + 20 j = −6 61 i + 5 61 j.

This is the unit vector that points in the same direction as ∇ f (−2, 3). To find the angle corresponding to this

unit vector, we solve the equations

cos θ = −6 61 and sin θ = 5 61
61
61
for θ. Since cosine is negative and sine is positive, the angle must be in the second quadrant. Therefore,

θ = π − arcsin⎛⎝⎛⎝5 61⎞⎠/61⎞⎠ ≈ 2.45 rad.

The maximum value of the directional derivative at (−2, 3) is ‖ ∇ f (−2, 3) ‖ = 4 61 (see the following
figure).

Figure 4.42 The maximum value of the directional derivative at
(−2, 3) is in the direction of the gradient.

Find the direction for which the directional derivative of g(x, y) = 4x − xy + 2y 2 at (−2, 3) is a

Figure 4.43 shows a portion of the graph of the function f (x, y) = 3 + sin x sin y. Given a point (a, b) in the domain
of f , the maximum value of the gradient at that point is given by ‖ ∇ f (a, b) ‖ . This would equal the rate of greatest
ascent if the surface represented a topographical map. If we went in the opposite direction, it would be the rate of greatest
descent.

Figure 4.43 A typical surface in ℝ 3. Given a point on the surface, the directional derivative
can be calculated using the gradient.

When using a topographical map, the steepest slope is always in the direction where the contour lines are closest together
(see Figure 4.44). This is analogous to the contour map of a function, assuming the level curves are obtained for equally
spaced values throughout the range of that function.

Figure 4.44 Contour map for the function

f (x, y) = x 2 − y 2 using level values between −5 and 5.

Gradients and Level Curves
Recall that if a curve is defined parametrically by the function pair ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠, then the vector x′ (t)i + y′ (t)j is tangent
to the curve for every value of t in the domain. Now let’s assume z = f (x, y) is a differentiable function of x and y, and

(x 0, y 0) is in its domain. Let’s suppose further that x 0 = x(t 0) and y 0 = y(t 0) for some value of t, and consider the

level curve f (x, y) = k. Define g(t) = f ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠ and calculate g′ (t) on the level curve. By the chain Rule,

g′ (t) = f x ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠x′ (t) + f y ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠y′ (t).

432

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

But g′ (t) = 0 because g(t) = k for all t. Therefore, on the one hand,

f x ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠x′ (t) + f y ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠y′ (t) = 0;
on the other hand,

f x ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠x′ (t) + f y ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠y′ (t) = ∇ f (x, y) · 〈 x′ (t), y′ (t) 〉 .
Therefore,

∇ f (x, y) · 〈 x′ (t), y′ (t) 〉 = 0.
Thus, the dot product of these vectors is equal to zero, which implies they are orthogonal. However, the second vector is
tangent to the level curve, which implies the gradient must be normal to the level curve, which gives rise to the following
theorem.

Theorem 4.14: Gradient Is Normal to the Level Curve
Suppose the function z = f (x, y) has continuous first-order partial derivatives in an open disk centered at a point

(x 0, y 0). If ∇ f (x 0, y 0) ≠ 0, then ∇ f (x 0, y 0) is normal to the level curve of f at (x 0, y 0).

We can use this theorem to find tangent and normal vectors to level curves of a function.

Example 4.35
Finding Tangents to Level Curves
For the function f (x, y) = 2x 2 − 3xy + 8y 2 + 2x − 4y + 4, find a tangent vector to the level curve at point

(−2, 1). Graph the level curve corresponding to f (x, y) = 18 and draw in ∇ f (−2, 1) and a tangent vector.
Solution
First, we must calculate ∇ f (x, y):

f x (x, y) = 4x − 3y + 2 and f y = −3x + 16y − 4 so ∇ f (x, y) = ⎛⎝4x − 3y + 2⎞⎠i + ⎛⎝−3x + 16y − 4⎞⎠j.
Next, we evaluate ∇ f (x, y) at (−2, 1):

∇ f (−2, 1) = ⎛⎝4(−2) − 3(1) + 2⎞⎠i + ⎛⎝−3(−2) + 16(1) − 4⎞⎠ j = −9i + 18j.
This vector is orthogonal to the curve at point (−2, 1). We can obtain a tangent vector by reversing the
components and multiplying either one by −1. Thus, for example, −18i − 9j is a tangent vector (see the
following graph).

Three-Dimensional Gradients and Directional Derivatives
The definition of a gradient can be extended to functions of more than two variables.

Definition
Let w = f (x, y, z) be a function of three variables such that f x, f y, and f z exist. The vector ∇ f (x, y, z) is called
the gradient of f and is defined as

∇ f (x, y, z) = f x (x, y, z)i + f y (x, y, z)j + f z (x, y, z)k.

(4.40)

∇ f (x, y, z) can also be written as grad f (x, y, z).
Calculating the gradient of a function in three variables is very similar to calculating the gradient of a function in two
variables. First, we calculate the partial derivatives f x, f y, and f z, and then we use Equation 4.40.

Example 4.36
Finding Gradients in Three Dimensions

b.

Solution

434

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

For both parts a. and b., we first calculate the partial derivatives f x, f y, and f z, then use Equation 4.40.
a.

f z (x, y, z) = 10x − 2y + 3z, f y (x, y, z) = −2x + 2y − 4z and f z (x, y, z) = 3x − 4y + 2z, so
∇ f (x, y, z) = f x (x, y, z)i + f y (x, y, z)j + f z (x, y, z)k

= ⎛⎝10x − 2y + 3z⎞⎠i + ⎛⎝−2x + 2y − 4z⎞⎠j + ⎛⎝−4x + 3y + 2z⎞⎠k.

f x (x, y, z) = −2e −2z cos 2x cos 2y, f y (x, y, z) = −2e −2z sin 2x sin 2y and
f z (x, y, z) = −2e −2z sin 2x cos 2y, so
∇ f (x, y, z) = f x (x, y, z)i + f y (x, y, z)j + f z (x, y, z)k

The directional derivative can also be generalized to functions of three variables. To determine a direction in three
dimensions, a vector with three components is needed. This vector is a unit vector, and the components of the unit vector are
called directional cosines. Given a three-dimensional unit vector u in standard form (i.e., the initial point is at the origin),
this vector forms three different angles with the positive x − , y − , and z-axes. Let’s call these angles α, β, and γ.
Then the directional cosines are given by cos α, cos β, and cos γ. These are the components of the unit vector u; since

u is a unit vector, it is true that cos 2 α + cos 2 β + cos 2 γ = 1.
Definition
Suppose w = f (x, y, z) is a function of three variables with a domain of D. Let (x 0, y 0, z 0) ∈ D and let

u = cos αi + cos βj + cos γk be a unit vector. Then, the directional derivative of f in the direction of u is given by

We can calculate the directional derivative of a function of three variables by using the gradient, leading to a formula that is
analogous to Equation 4.38.

Theorem 4.15: Directional Derivative of a Function of Three Variables
Let f (x, y, z) be a differentiable function of three variables and let u = cos αi + cos βj + cos γk be a unit vector.
Then, the directional derivative of f in the direction of u is given by

D u f (x, y, z) = ∇ f (x, y, z) · u
= f x (x, y, z)cos α + f y (x, y, z)cos β + f z (x, y, z)cos γ.

The three angles α, β, and γ determine the unit vector u. In practice, we can use an arbitrary (nonunit) vector, then divide
by its magnitude to obtain a unit vector in the desired direction.

4.7 | Maxima/Minima Problems
Learning Objectives
4.7.1 Use partial derivatives to locate critical points for a function of two variables.
4.7.2 Apply a second derivative test to identify a critical point as a local maximum, local minimum,
or saddle point for a function of two variables.
4.7.3 Examine critical points and boundary points to find absolute maximum and minimum values
for a function of two variables.
One of the most useful applications for derivatives of a function of one variable is the determination of maximum and/or
minimum values. This application is also important for functions of two or more variables, but as we have seen in earlier
sections of this chapter, the introduction of more independent variables leads to more possible outcomes for the calculations.
The main ideas of finding critical points and using derivative tests are still valid, but new wrinkles appear when assessing
the results.

Critical Points
For functions of a single variable, we defined critical points as the values of the function when the derivative equals zero
or does not exist. For functions of two or more variables, the concept is essentially the same, except for the fact that we are
now working with partial derivatives.

Definition
Let z = f (x, y) be a function of two variables that is defined on an open set containing the point (x 0, y 0). The point

(x 0, y 0) is called a critical point of a function of two variables f if one of the two following conditions holds:
f x (x 0, y 0) = f y (x 0, y 0) = 0

1.

2. Either f x (x 0, y 0) or f y (x 0, y 0) does not exist.

Example 4.38
Finding Critical Points
Find the critical points of each of the following functions:
a.

f (x, y) = 4y 2 − 9x 2 + 24y + 36x + 36

b.

g(x, y) = x 2 + 2xy − 4y 2 + 4x − 6y + 4

Solution
a. First, we calculate f x (x, y) and f y (x, y):

Next, we set each of these expressions equal to zero:

4y − 9x 2 + 24y + 36x + 36
4y + 12
= 0.
2
2
4y − 9x + 24y + 36x + 36
2

Then, multiply each equation by its common denominator:

−9x + 18 = 0
4y + 12 = 0.
Therefore, x = 2 and y = −3, so (2, −3) is a critical point of f .
We must also check for the possibility that the denominator of each partial derivative can equal zero, thus
causing the partial derivative not to exist. Since the denominator is the same in each partial derivative, we
need only do this once:

4y 2 − 9x 2 + 24y + 36x + 36 = 0.
This equation represents a hyperbola. We should also note that the domain of f consists of points
satisfying the inequality

4y 2 − 9x 2 + 24y + 36x + 36 ≥ 0.
Therefore, any points on the hyperbola are not only critical points, they are also on the boundary of the
domain. To put the hyperbola in standard form, we use the method of completing the square:

4y 2 − 9x 2 + 24y + 36x + 36 = 0

4y 2 − 9x 2 + 24y + 36x = −36

4y 2 + 24y − 9x 2 + 36x = −36

4⎛⎝y 2 + 6y + 9⎞⎠ − 9⎛⎝x 2 − 4x + 4⎞⎠ = −36 + 36 − 36
4⎛⎝y + 3⎞⎠ 2 − 9(x − 2) 2 = −36.
Dividing both sides by −36 puts the equation in standard form:

b. First, we calculate g x (x, y) and g y (x, y):

g x (x, y) = 2x + 2y + 4
g y (x, y) = 2x − 8y − 6.
Next, we set each of these expressions equal to zero, which gives a system of equations in x and y:

2x + 2y + 4 = 0
2x − 8y − 6 = 0.
Subtracting the second equation from the first gives 10y + 10 = 0, so y = −1. Substituting this into
the first equation gives 2x + 2(−1) + 4 = 0, so x = −1. Therefore (−1, −1) is a critical point of g
(Figure 4.46). There are no points in ℝ 2 that make either partial derivative not exist.

Figure 4.46 The function g(x, y) has a critical point at (−1, −1, 6).

Find the critical point of the function f (x, y) = x 3 + 2xy − 2x − 4y.

The main purpose for determining critical points is to locate relative maxima and minima, as in single-variable calculus.
When working with a function of one variable, the definition of a local extremum involves finding an interval around the
critical point such that the function value is either greater than or less than all the other function values in that interval.
When working with a function of two or more variables, we work with an open disk around the point.

Definition
Let z = f (x, y) be a function of two variables that is defined and continuous on an open set containing the point

(x 0, y 0). Then f has a local maximum at (x 0, y 0) if
f (x 0, y 0) ≥ f (x, y)
for all points (x, y) within some disk centered at (x 0, y 0). The number f (x 0, y 0) is called a local maximum value.
If the preceding inequality holds for every point (x, y) in the domain of f , then f has a global maximum (also
called an absolute maximum) at (x 0, y 0).
The function f has a local minimum at (x 0, y 0) if

f (x 0, y 0) ≤ f (x, y)
for all points (x, y) within some disk centered at (x 0, y 0). The number f (x 0, y 0) is called a local minimum value. If

the preceding inequality holds for every point (x, y) in the domain of f , then f has a global minimum (also called
an absolute minimum) at (x 0, y 0).

If f (x 0, y 0) is either a local maximum or local minimum value, then it is called a local extremum (see the following
figure).

Figure 4.47 The graph of z = 16 − x 2 − y 2 has a
maximum value when (x, y) = (0, 0). It attains its minimum
value at the boundary of its domain, which is the circle

x 2 + y 2 = 16.

In Maxima and Minima (http://cnx.org/content/m53611/latest/) , we showed that extrema of functions of one
variable occur at critical points. The same is true for functions of more than one variable, as stated in the following theorem.

Theorem 4.16: Fermat’s Theorem for Functions of Two Variables
Let z = f (x, y) be a function of two variables that is defined and continuous on an open set containing the point

442

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

(x 0, y 0). Suppose f x and f y each exists at (x 0, y 0). If f has a local extremum at (x 0, y 0), then (x 0, y 0) is a
critical point of f .

Second Derivative Test
Consider the function f (x) = x 3. This function has a critical point at x = 0, since f ′(0) = 3(0) 2 = 0. However, f
does not have an extreme value at x = 0. Therefore, the existence of a critical value at x = x 0 does not guarantee a local

extremum at x = x 0. The same is true for a function of two or more variables. One way this can happen is at a saddle
point. An example of a saddle point appears in the following figure.

Figure 4.48 Graph of the function z = x 2 − y 2. This graph
has a saddle point at the origin.

In this graph, the origin is a saddle point. This is because the first partial derivatives of f (x, y) = x 2 − y 2 are both equal to
zero at this point, but it is neither a maximum nor a minimum for the function. Furthermore the vertical trace corresponding
to y = 0 is z = x 2 (a parabola opening upward), but the vertical trace corresponding to x = 0 is z = −y 2 (a parabola
opening downward). Therefore, it is both a global maximum for one trace and a global minimum for another.

Definition
the point ⎛⎝x 0, y 0, f (x 0, y 0)⎞⎠ is a saddle point if both f 0 (x 0, y 0) = 0 and
f y (x 0, y 0) = 0, but f does not have a local extremum at (x 0, y 0).

Given the function z = f (x, y),

The second derivative test for a function of one variable provides a method for determining whether an extremum occurs at
a critical point of a function. When extending this result to a function of two variables, an issue arises related to the fact that
there are, in fact, four different second-order partial derivatives, although equality of mixed partials reduces this to three.
The second derivative test for a function of two variables, stated in the following theorem, uses a discriminant D that
replaces f ″(x 0) in the second derivative test for a function of one variable.

Theorem 4.17: Second Derivative Test
Let z = f (x, y) be a function of two variables for which the first- and second-order partial derivatives are continuous
on some disk containing the point (x 0, y 0). Suppose f x (x 0, y 0) = 0 and f y (x 0, y 0) = 0. Define the quantity

D = f xx (x 0, y 0) f yy (x 0, y 0) − ⎛⎝ f xy (x 0, y 0)⎞⎠ 2.

(4.43)

i. If D > 0 and f xx (x 0, y 0) > 0, then f has a local minimum at (x 0, y 0).
ii. If D > 0 and f xx (x 0, y 0) < 0, then f has a local maximum at (x 0, y 0).
iii. If D < 0, , then f has a saddle point at (x 0, y 0).
iv. If D = 0, then the test is inconclusive.
See Figure 4.49.

Figure 4.49 The second derivative test can often determine whether a function of two variables has a local minima (a), a
local maxima (b), or a saddle point (c).

To apply the second derivative test, it is necessary that we first find the critical points of the function. There are several
steps involved in the entire procedure, which are outlined in a problem-solving strategy.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Using the Second Derivative Test for Functions of Two Variables
Let z = f (x, y) be a function of two variables for which the first- and second-order partial derivatives are continuous
on some disk containing the point (x 0, y 0). To apply the second derivative test to find local extrema, use the following
steps:
1. Determine the critical points (x 0, y 0) of the function f where f x (x 0, y 0) = f y (x 0, y 0) = 0. Discard any
points where at least one of the partial derivatives does not exist.
2. Calculate the discriminant D = f xx (x 0, y 0) f yy (x 0, y 0) − ⎛⎝ f xy (x 0, y 0)⎞⎠ 2 for each critical point of f .

444

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

3. Apply Second Derivative Test to determine whether each critical point is a local maximum, local
minimum, or saddle point, or whether the theorem is inconclusive.

Example 4.39
Using the Second Derivative Test
Find the critical points for each of the following functions, and use the second derivative test to find the local
extrema:
a.

f (x, y) = 4x 2 + 9y 2 + 8x − 36y + 24

b.

g(x, y) = 1 x 3 + y 2 + 2xy − 6x − 3y + 4
3

Solution
a. Step 1 of the problem-solving strategy involves finding the critical points of f . To do this, we first
calculate f x (x, y) and f y (x, y), then set each of them equal to zero:

f x (x, y) = 8x + 8
f y (x, y) = 18y − 36.
Setting them equal to zero yields the system of equations

8x + 8 = 0
18y − 36 = 0.
The solution to this system is x = −1 and y = 2. Therefore (−1, 2) is a critical point of f .
Step 2 of the problem-solving strategy involves calculating D. To do this, we first calculate the second
partial derivatives of f :

f xx (x, y) = 8
f xy (x, y) = 0
f yy (x, y) = 18.
Therefore, D = f xx (−1, 2) f yy (−1, 2) − ⎛⎝ f xy (−1, 2)⎞⎠ 2 = (8)(18) − (0) 2 = 144.
Step 3 states to check Fermat’s Theorem for Functions of Two Variables. Since D > 0 and
f xx (−1, 2) > 0, this corresponds to case 1. Therefore, f has a local minimum at (−1, 2) as shown in
the following figure.

445

Figure 4.50 The function f (x, y) has a local minimum at (−1, 2, −16).

b. For step 1, we first calculate g x (x, y) and g y (x, y), then set each of them equal to zero:

g x (x, y) = x 2 + 2y − 6
g y (x, y) = 2y + 2x − 3.
Setting them equal to zero yields the system of equations

x 2 + 2y − 6 = 0
2y + 2x − 3 = 0.

To solve this system, first solve the second equation for y. This gives y = 3 − 2x . Substituting this into

2

the first equation gives

x 2 + 3 − 2x − 6 = 0
x 2 − 2x − 3 = 0
(x − 3)(x + 1) = 0.

Therefore, x = −1 or x = 3. Substituting these values into the equation y = 3 − 2x yields the critical

Step 2 involves calculating the second partial derivatives of g:

g xx (x, y) = 2x
g xy (x, y) = 2
g yy (x, y) = 2.
Then, we find a general formula for D:

D = g xx (x 0, y 0)g yy (x 0, y 0) − ⎛⎝g xy (x 0, y 0)⎞⎠ 2
= ⎛⎝2x 0⎞⎠(2) − 2 2
= 4x 0 − 4.

Use the second derivative to find the local extrema of the function

f (x, y) = x 3 + 2xy − 6x − 4y 2.

Absolute Maxima and Minima
When finding global extrema of functions of one variable on a closed interval, we start by checking the critical values over
that interval and then evaluate the function at the endpoints of the interval. When working with a function of two variables,
the closed interval is replaced by a closed, bounded set. A set is bounded if all the points in that set can be contained within
a ball (or disk) of finite radius. First, we need to find the critical points inside the set and calculate the corresponding critical
values. Then, it is necessary to find the maximum and minimum value of the function on the boundary of the set. When
we have all these values, the largest function value corresponds to the global maximum and the smallest function value
corresponds to the absolute minimum. First, however, we need to be assured that such values exist. The following theorem
does this.

Theorem 4.18: Extreme Value Theorem
A continuous function f (x, y) on a closed and bounded set D in the plane attains an absolute maximum value at
some point of D and an absolute minimum value at some point of D.

Now that we know any continuous function f defined on a closed, bounded set attains its extreme values, we need to know
how to find them.

Theorem 4.19: Finding Extreme Values of a Function of Two Variables
Assume z = f (x, y) is a differentiable function of two variables defined on a closed, bounded set D. Then f will
attain the absolute maximum value and the absolute minimum value, which are, respectively, the largest and smallest
values found among the following:
i. The values of f at the critical points of f in D.
ii. The values of f on the boundary of D.

The proof of this theorem is a direct consequence of the extreme value theorem and Fermat’s theorem. In particular, if
either extremum is not located on the boundary of D, then it is located at an interior point of D. But an interior point

(x 0, y 0) of D that’s an absolute extremum is also a local extremum; hence, (x 0, y 0) is a critical point of f by Fermat’s

theorem. Therefore the only possible values for the global extrema of f on D are the extreme values of f on the interior
or boundary of D.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Finding Absolute Maximum and Minimum Values
Let z = f (x, y) be a continuous function of two variables defined on a closed, bounded set D, and assume f is
differentiable on D. To find the absolute maximum and minimum values of f on D, do the following:
1. Determine the critical points of f in D.
2. Calculate f at each of these critical points.
3. Determine the maximum and minimum values of f on the boundary of its domain.
4. The maximum and minimum values of f will occur at one of the values obtained in steps 2 and 3.

Finding the maximum and minimum values of f on the boundary of D can be challenging. If the boundary is a rectangle
or set of straight lines, then it is possible to parameterize the line segments and determine the maxima on each of these
segments, as seen in Example 4.40. The same approach can be used for other shapes such as circles and ellipses.
If the boundary of the set D is a more complicated curve defined by a function g(x, y) = c for some constant c, and
the first-order partial derivatives of g exist, then the method of Lagrange multipliers can prove useful for determining the
extrema of f on the boundary. The method of Lagrange multipliers is introduced in Lagrange Multipliers.

Example 4.40
Finding Absolute Extrema

448

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

Use the problem-solving strategy for finding absolute extrema of a function to determine the absolute extrema of
each of the following functions:
a.

f (x, y) = x 2 − 2xy + 4y 2 − 4x − 2y + 24 on the domain defined by 0 ≤ x ≤ 4 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 2

b.

g(x, y) = x 2 + y 2 + 4x − 6y on the domain defined by x 2 + y 2 ≤ 16

Solution
a. Using the problem-solving strategy, step 1 involves finding the critical points of f on its domain.
Therefore, we first calculate f x (x, y) and f y (x, y), then set them each equal to zero:

f x (x, y) = 2x − 2y − 4
f y (x, y) = −2x + 8y − 2.
Setting them equal to zero yields the system of equations

2x − 2y − 4 = 0
−2x + 8y − 2 = 0.
The solution to this system is x = 3 and y = 1. Therefore (3, 1) is a critical point of f . Calculating

f (3, 1) gives f (3, 1) = 17.
The next step involves finding the extrema of f on the boundary of its domain. The boundary of its
domain consists of four line segments as shown in the following graph:

Figure 4.52 Graph of the domain of the function

f (x, y) = x 2 − 2xy + 4y 2 − 4x − 2y + 24.

L 1 is the line segment connecting (0, 0) and (4, 0), and it can be parameterized by the equations
x(t) = t, y(t) = 0 for 0 ≤ t ≤ 4. Define g(t) = f ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠. This gives g(t) = t 2 − 4t + 24.
Differentiating g leads to g′ (t) = 2t − 4. Therefore, g has a critical value at t = 2, which corresponds
to the point (2, 0). Calculating f (2, 0) gives the z-value 20.

L 2 is the line segment connecting (4, 0) and (4, 2), and it can be parameterized by the equations
x(t) = 4, y(t) = t for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2. Again, define g(t) = f ⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠. This gives g(t) = 4t 2 − 10t + 24.
Then, g′ (t) = 8t − 10. g has a critical value at t = 5 ,

(0, 0), (4, 0), (4, 2) and (0, 2):
f (0, 0) = (0) 2 − 2(0)(0) + 4(0) 2 − 4(0) − 2(0) + 24 = 24

f (4, 0) = (4) 2 − 2(4)(0) + 4(0) 2 − 4(4) − 2(0) + 24 = 24

f (4, 2) = (4) 2 − 2(4)(2) + 4(2) 2 − 4(4) − 2(2) + 24 = 20

f (0, 2) = (0) 2 − 2(0)(2) + 4(2) 2 − 4(0) − 2(2) + 24 = 36.
The absolute maximum value is 36, which occurs at (0, 2), and the global minimum value is 20,
which occurs at both (4, 2) and (2, 0) as shown in the following figure.

b. Using the problem-solving strategy, step 1 involves finding the critical points of g on its domain.
Therefore, we first calculate g x (x, y) and g y (x, y), then set them each equal to zero:

g x (x, y) = 2x + 4
g y (x, y) = 2y − 6.
Setting them equal to zero yields the system of equations

2x + 4 = 0
2y − 6 = 0.
The solution to this system is x = −2 and y = 3. Therefore, (−2, 3) is a critical point of g.
Calculating g(−2, 3), we get

g(−2, 3) = (−2) 2 + 3 2 + 4(−2) − 6(3) = 4 + 9 − 8 − 18 = −13.
The next step involves finding the extrema of g on the boundary of its domain. The boundary of its
domain consists of a circle of radius 4 centered at the origin as shown in the following graph.

Figure 4.54 Graph of the domain of the function

g(x, y) = x 2 + y 2 + 4x − 6y.

The boundary of the domain of g can be parameterized using the functions x(t) = 4 cos t, y(t) = 4 sin t
for 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. Define h(t) = g⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠:

h(t) = g⎛⎝x(t), y(t)⎞⎠

= (4 cos t) 2 + (4 sin t) 2 + 4(4 cos t) − 6(4 sin t)

= 16cos 2 t + 16sin 2 t + 16 cos t − 24 sin t

z = f (x, y) = 48x + 96y − x 2 − 2xy − 9y 2,
where z is measured in thousands of dollars. The maximum number of golf balls that can be produced and sold
is 50,000, and the maximum number of hours of advertising that can be purchased is 25. Find the values of x
and y that maximize profit, and find the maximum profit.

Solution
Using the problem-solving strategy, step 1 involves finding the critical points of f on its domain. Therefore, we
first calculate f x (x, y) and f y (x, y), then set them each equal to zero:

f x (x, y) = 48 − 2x − 2y
f y (x, y) = 96 − 2x − 18y.
Setting them equal to zero yields the system of equations

48 − 2x − 2y = 0
96 − 2x − 18y = 0.
The solution to this system is x = 21 and y = 3. Therefore (21, 3) is a critical point of f . Calculating

f (21, 3) gives f (21, 3) = 48(21) + 96(3) − 21 2 − 2(21)(3) − 9(3) 2 = 648.
The domain of this function is 0 ≤ x ≤ 50 and 0 ≤ y ≤ 25 as shown in the following graph.

We also need to find the values of f (x, y) at the corners of its domain. These corners are located at

(0, 0), (50, 0), (50, 25) and (0, 25):
f (0, 0) = 48(0) + 96(0) − (0) 2 − 2(0)(0) − 9(0) 2 = 0

f (50, 0) = 48(50) + 96(0) − (50) 2 − 2(50)(0) − 9(0) 2 = −100

f (50, 25) = 48(50) + 96(25) − (50) 2 − 2(50)(25) − 9(25) 2 = −5825
f (0, 25) = 48(0) + 96(25) − (0) 2 − 2(0)(25) − 9(25) 2 = −3225.

The maximum critical value is 648, which occurs at (21, 3). Therefore, a maximum profit of $648,000 is
realized when 21,000 golf balls are sold and 3 hours of advertising are purchased per month as shown in the

4.8 | Lagrange Multipliers
Learning Objectives
4.8.1 Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve optimization problems with one constraint.
4.8.2 Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to solve optimization problems with two
constraints.
Solving optimization problems for functions of two or more variables can be similar to solving such problems in singlevariable calculus. However, techniques for dealing with multiple variables allow us to solve more varied optimization
problems for which we need to deal with additional conditions or constraints. In this section, we examine one of the more
common and useful methods for solving optimization problems with constraints.

Lagrange Multipliers
Example 4.41 was an applied situation involving maximizing a profit function, subject to certain constraints. In that
example, the constraints involved a maximum number of golf balls that could be produced and sold in 1 month (x),
and a maximum number of advertising hours that could be purchased per month (y). Suppose these were combined
into a budgetary constraint, such as 20x + 4y ≤ 216,

that took into account the cost of producing the golf balls

and the number of advertising hours purchased per month. The goal is, still, be to maximize profit, but now there
is a different type of constraint on the values of x and y. This constraint, when combined with the profit function

f (x, y) = 48x + 96y − x 2 − 2xy − 9y 2, is an example of an optimization problem, and the function f (x, y) is called
the objective function. A graph of various level curves of the function f (x, y) follows.

Figure 4.59 Graph of level curves of the function

f (x, y) = 48x + 96y − x 2 − 2xy − 9y 2 corresponding to

c = 150, 250, 350, and 400.
In Figure 4.59, the value c represents different profit levels (i.e., values of the function f ). As the value of c increases,
the curve shifts to the right. Since our goal is to maximize profit, we want to choose a curve as far to the right as possible.
If there was no restriction on the number of golf balls the company could produce, or the number of units of advertising
available, then we could produce as many golf balls as we want, and advertise as much as we want, and there would be
not be a maximum profit for the company. Unfortunately, we have a budgetary constraint that is modeled by the inequality
20x + 4y ≤ 216. To see how this constraint interacts with the profit function, Figure 4.60 shows the graph of the line

20x + 4y = 216 superimposed on the previous graph.

Figure 4.60 Graph of level curves of the function

f (x, y) = 48x + 96y − x 2 − 2xy − 9y 2 corresponding to

c = 150, 250, 350, and 395. The red graph is the constraint
function.

As mentioned previously, the maximum profit occurs when the level curve is as far to the right as possible. However, the
level of production corresponding to this maximum profit must also satisfy the budgetary constraint, so the point at which
this profit occurs must also lie on (or to the left of) the red line in Figure 4.60. Inspection of this graph reveals that this
point exists where the line is tangent to the level curve of f . Trial and error reveals that this profit level seems to be
around 395, when x and y are both just less than 5. We return to the solution of this problem later in this section.
From a theoretical standpoint, at the point where the profit curve is tangent to the constraint line, the gradient of both of
the functions evaluated at that point must point in the same (or opposite) direction. Recall that the gradient of a function
of more than one variable is a vector. If two vectors point in the same (or opposite) directions, then one must be a constant
multiple of the other. This idea is the basis of the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Theorem 4.20: Method of Lagrange Multipliers: One Constraint
Let f and g be functions of two variables with continuous partial derivatives at every point of some open set
containing the smooth curve g(x, y) = 0. Suppose that f , when restricted to points on the curve g(x, y) = 0,
has a local extremum at the point (x 0, y 0) and that ∇ g(x 0, y 0) ≠ 0. Then there is a number λ called a Lagrange
multiplier, for which

∇ f (x 0, y 0) = λ∇ g(x 0, y 0).

Proof
Assume that a constrained extremum occurs at the point (x 0, y 0). Furthermore, we assume that the equation g(x, y) = 0
can be smoothly parameterized as

x = x(s) and y = y(s)
where s is an arc length parameter with reference point (x 0, y 0) at s = 0. Therefore, the quantity z = f ⎛⎝x(s), y(s)⎞⎠ has a
relative maximum or relative minimum at s = 0, and this implies that dz = 0 at that point. From the chain rule,

ds

dz = ∂ f · ∂ x + ∂ f · ∂ y = ⎛∂ f i + j ∂ x ⎞ + ⎛∂ f · ∂ y ⎞ = 0,
∂ s ⎠ ⎝∂ y ∂ s ⎠
ds ∂ x ∂ s ∂ y ∂ s ⎝ ∂ x
where the derivatives are all evaluated at s = 0. However, the first factor in the dot product is the gradient of f , and the
second factor is the unit tangent vector T(0) to the constraint curve. Since the point (x 0, y 0) corresponds to s = 0, it
follows from this equation that

460

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

∇ f (x 0, y 0) · T(0) = 0,
which implies that the gradient is either 0 or is normal to the constraint curve at a constrained relative extremum. However,
the constraint curve g(x, y) = 0 is a level curve for the function g(x, y) so that if ∇ g(x 0, y 0) ≠ 0 then ∇ g(x 0, y 0) is

normal to this curve at (x 0, y 0) It follows, then, that there is some scalar λ such that

∇ f (x 0, y 0) = λ∇ g(x 0, y 0)
□
To apply Method of Lagrange Multipliers: One Constraint to an optimization problem similar to that for the golf
ball manufacturer, we need a problem-solving strategy.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Steps for Using Lagrange Multipliers
1. Determine the objective function f (x, y) and the constraint function g(x, y). Does the optimization problem
involve maximizing or minimizing the objective function?
2. Set up a system of equations using the following template:

∇ f (x 0, y 0) = λ∇ g(x 0, y 0)
g(x 0, y 0) = 0.
3. Solve for x 0 and y 0.
4. The largest of the values of f at the solutions found in step 3 maximizes f ; the smallest of those values
minimizes f .

Example 4.42
Using Lagrange Multipliers
Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the minimum value of f (x, y) = x 2 + 4y 2 − 2x + 8y subject to
the constraint x + 2y = 7.

Solution
Let’s follow the problem-solving strategy:
1. The optimization function is f (x, y) = x 2 + 4y 2 − 2x + 8y. To determine the constraint function, we
must first subtract 7 from both sides of the constraint. This gives x + 2y − 7 = 0. The constraint
function is equal to the left-hand side, so g(x, y) = x + 2y − 7. The problem asks us to solve for the
minimum value of f , subject to the constraint (see the following graph).

f (x, y) = x 2 + 4y 2 − 2x + 8y corresponding to c = 10 and

26. The red graph is the constraint function.
2. We then must calculate the gradients of both f and g:

∇ f (x, y) = (2x − 2)i + ⎛⎝8y + 8⎞⎠j
∇ g(x, y) = i + 2j.
The equation ∇ f (x 0, y 0) = λ∇ g(x 0, y 0) becomes
⎛
⎝

2x 0 − 2⎞⎠i + ⎛⎝8y 0 + 8⎞⎠j = λ⎛⎝i + 2j⎞⎠,

which can be rewritten as
⎛
⎝

2x 0 − 2⎞⎠i + ⎛⎝8y 0 + 8⎞⎠j = λi + 2λj.

Next, we set the coefficients of i and j equal to each other:

2x 0 − 2 = λ
8y 0 + 8 = 2λ.
The equation g(x 0, y 0) = 0 becomes x 0 + 2y 0 − 7 = 0. Therefore, the system of equations that needs
to be solved is

2x 0 − 2 = λ
8y 0 + 8 = 2λ
x 0 + 2y 0 − 7 = 0.
3. This is a linear system of three equations in three variables. We start by solving the second equation for
λ and substituting it into the first equation. This gives λ = 4y 0 + 4, so substituting this into the first
equation gives

2x 0 − 2 = 4y 0 + 4.
Solving this equation for x 0 gives x 0 = 2y 0 + 3. We then substitute this into the third equation:

462

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

⎛
⎝

2y 0 + 3⎞⎠ + 2y 0 − 7 = 0
4y 0 − 4 = 0
y 0 = 1.

Since x 0 = 2y 0 + 3, this gives x 0 = 5.
4. Next,

we

substitute

(5, 1)

into

f (x, y) = x 2 + 4y 2 − 2x + 8y,

gives

f (5, 1) = 5 2 + 4(1) 2 − 2(5) + 8(1) = 27. To ensure this corresponds to a minimum value on the
constraint function, let’s try some other values, such as the intercepts of g(x, y) = 0, Which are (7, 0)
and (0, 3.5). We get f (7, 0) = 35 and f (0, 3.5) = 77, so it appears f has a minimum at (5, 1).

4.37 Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the
f (x, y) = 9x 2 + 36xy − 4y 2 − 18x − 8y subject to the constraint 3x + 4y = 32.

Let’s now return to the problem posed at the beginning of the section.

Example 4.43
Golf Balls and Lagrange Multipliers
The golf ball manufacturer, Pro-T, has developed a profit model that depends on the number x of golf balls sold
per month (measured in thousands), and the number of hours per month of advertising y, according to the function

z = f (x, y) = 48x + 96y − x 2 − 2xy − 9y 2,
where z is measured in thousands of dollars. The budgetary constraint function relating the cost of the production
of thousands golf balls and advertising units is given by 20x + 4y = 216. Find the values of x and y that
maximize profit, and find the maximum profit.

Solution
Again, we follow the problem-solving strategy:
1. The optimization function is f (x, y) = 48x + 96y − x 2 − 2xy − 9y 2. To determine the constraint
function, we first subtract 216 from both sides of the constraint, then divide both sides by 4, which gives

5x + y − 54 = 0. The constraint function is equal to the left-hand side, so g(x, y) = 5x + y − 54. The
problem asks us to solve for the maximum value of f , subject to this constraint.
2. So, we calculate the gradients of both f and g:

∇ f (x, y) = ⎛⎝48 − 2x − 2y⎞⎠i + ⎛⎝96 − 2x − 18y⎞⎠j
∇ g(x, y) = 5i + j.
The equation ∇ f (x 0, y 0) = λ∇ g(x 0, y 0) becomes
⎛
⎝

48 − 2x 0 − 2y 0⎞⎠i + ⎛⎝96 − 2x 0 − 18y 0⎞⎠j = λ⎛⎝5i + j⎞⎠,

463

which can be rewritten as
⎛
⎝

48 − 2x 0 − 2y 0⎞⎠i + ⎛⎝96 − 2x 0 − 18y 0⎞⎠j = λ5i + λj.

We then set the coefficients of i and j equal to each other:

48 − 2x 0 − 2y 0 = 5λ
96 − 2x 0 − 18y 0 = λ.
The equation g(x 0, y 0) = 0 becomes 5x 0 + y 0 − 54 = 0. Therefore, the system of equations that needs
to be solved is

48 − 2x 0 − 2y 0 = 5λ
96 − 2x 0 − 18y 0 = λ
5x 0 + y 0 − 54 = 0.

3. We use the left-hand side of the second equation to replace λ in the first equation:

48 − 2x 0 − 2y 0
48 − 2x 0 − 2y 0
8x 0
x0

480 − 10x 0 − 90y 0
432 − 88y 0
54 − 11y 0.

Then we substitute this into the third equation:

5⎛⎝54 − 11y 0⎞⎠ + y 0 − 54 = 0

270 − 55y 0 + y 0 = 0
216 − 54y 0 = 0
y 0 = 4.

Since x 0 = 54 − 11y 0, this gives x 0 = 10.
4. We then substitute (10, 4) into f (x, y) = 48x + 96y − x 2 − 2xy − 9y 2, which gives

f (10, 4) = 48(10) + 96(4) − (10) 2 − 2(10)(4) − 9(4) 2
= 480 + 384 − 100 − 80 − 144 = 540.
Therefore the maximum profit that can be attained, subject to budgetary constraints, is $540,000 with
a production level of 10,000 golf balls and 4 hours of advertising bought per month. Let’s check to
make sure this truly is a maximum. The endpoints of the line that defines the constraint are (10.8, 0) and

(0, 54) Let’s evaluate f at both of these points:
f (10.8, 0) = 48(10.8) + 96(0) − 10.8 2 − 2(10.8)(0) − 9⎛⎝0 2⎞⎠ = 401.76
f (0, 54) = 48(0) + 96(54) − 0 2 − 2(0)(54) − 9⎛⎝54 2⎞⎠ = −21, 060.

The second value represents a loss, since no golf balls are produced. Neither of these values exceed 540,
so it seems that our extremum is a maximum value of f .

464

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

4.38 A company has determined that its production level is given by the Cobb-Douglas function
f (x, y) = 2.5x 0.45 y 0.55 where x represents the total number of labor hours in 1 year and y represents the total
capital input for the company. Suppose 1 unit of labor costs $40 and 1 unit of capital costs $50. Use the
method of Lagrange multipliers to find the maximum value of f (x, y) = 2.5x 0.45 y 0.55 subject to a budgetary
constraint of $500,000 per year.
In the case of an optimization function with three variables and a single constraint function, it is possible to use the method
of Lagrange multipliers to solve an optimization problem as well. An example of an optimization function with three
variables could be the Cobb-Douglas function in the previous example: f (x, y, z) = x 0.2 y 0.4 z 0.4, where x represents
the cost of labor, y represents capital input, and z represents the cost of advertising. The method is the same as for the
method with a function of two variables; the equations to be solved are

∇ f (x, y, z) = λ∇ g(x, y, z)
g(x, y, z) = 0.

Example 4.44
Lagrange Multipliers with a Three-Variable Optimization Function
Maximize the function f (x, y, z) = x 2 + y 2 + z 2 subject to the constraint x + y + z = 1.

Solution
1. The optimization function is f (x, y, z) = x 2 + y 2 + z 2. To determine the constraint function, we
subtract 1 from each side of the constraint: x + y + z − 1 = 0 which gives the constraint function as

g(x, y, z) = x + y + z − 1.
2. Next, we calculate ∇ f (x, y, z) and ∇ g(x, y, z):

∇ f (x, y, z) = 〈 2x, 2y, 2z 〉
∇ g(x, y, z) = 〈 1, 1, 1 〉 .
This leads to the equations

〈 2x 0, 2y 0, 2z 0 〉 = λ 〈 1, 1, 1 〉
x0 + y0 + z0 − 1 = 0
which can be rewritten in the following form:

2x 0
2y 0
2z 0
x0 + y0 + z0 − 1

0.

3. Since each of the first three equations has λ on the right-hand side, we know that 2x 0 = 2y 0 = 2z 0

and all three variables are equal to each other. Substituting y 0 = x 0 and z 0 = x 0 into the last equation

yields 3x 0 − 1 = 0, so x 0 = 1 and y 0 = 1 and z 0 = 1 which corresponds to a critical point on the

Therefore, an extremum of the function is 1 . To verify it is a minimum, choose other points that satisfy

f (1, 0, 0) = 1 2 + 0 2 + 0 2 = 1

f (0, −2, 3) = 0 2 + + (−2) 2 + 3 2 = 13.
Both of these values are greater than 1 , leading us to believe the extremum is a minimum.

Use the method of Lagrange multipliers to find the minimum value of the function

f (x, y, z) = x + y + z
subject to the constraint x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = 1.

Problems with Two Constraints
The method of Lagrange multipliers can be applied to problems with more than one constraint. In this case the optimization
function, w is a function of three variables:

w = f (x, y, z)
and it is subject to two constraints:

g(x, y, z) = 0 and h(x, y, z) = 0.
There are two Lagrange multipliers, λ 1 and λ 2, and the system of equations becomes

∇ f (x 0, y 0, z 0) = λ 1∇ g(x 0, y 0, z 0) + λ 2∇ h(x 0, y 0, z 0)
g(x 0, y 0, z 0) = 0
h(x 0, y 0, z 0) = 0.

Lagrange Multipliers with Two Constraints
Find the maximum and minimum values of the function

f (x, y, z) = x 2 + y 2 + z 2

Solution

466

Chapter 4 | Differentiation of Functions of Several Variables

Let’s follow the problem-solving strategy:
1. The optimization function is f (x, y, z) = x 2 + y 2 + z 2. To determine the constraint functions, we
first subtract z 2 from both sides of the first constraint, which gives x 2 + y 2 − z 2 = 0,

so

g(x, y, z) = x 2 + y 2 − z 2. The second constraint function is h(x, y, z) = x + y − z + 1.
2. We then calculate the gradients of f , g, and h:

∇ f (x, y, z) = 2xi + 2yj + 2zk
∇ g(x, y, z) = 2xi + 2yj − 2zk
∇ h(x, y, z) = i + j − k.
The equation ∇ f (x 0, y 0, z 0) = λ 1∇ g(x 0, y 0, z 0) + λ 2∇ h(x 0, y 0, z 0) becomes

2x 0 i + 2y 0 j + 2z 0 k = λ 1 ⎛⎝2x 0 i + 2y 0 j − 2z 0 k⎞⎠ + λ 2 ⎛⎝i + j − k⎞⎠,
which can be rewritten as

2x 0 i + 2y 0 j + 2z 0 k = ⎛⎝2λ 1 x 0 + λ 2⎞⎠i + ⎛⎝2λ 1 y 0 + λ 2⎞⎠j − ⎛⎝2λ 1 z 0 + λ 2⎞⎠k.
Next, we set the coefficients of i and j equal to each other:

2x 0 = 2λ 1 x 0 + λ 2
2y 0 = 2λ 1 y 0 + λ 2
2z 0 = −2λ 1 z 0 − λ 2.
The two equations that arise from the constraints are z 0 2 = x 0 2 + y 0 2 and x 0 + y 0 − z 0 + 1 = 0.
Combining these equations with the previous three equations gives

2x 0 = 2λ 1 x 0 + λ 2
2y 0 = 2λ 1 y 0 + λ 2
2z 0 = −2λ 1 z 0 − λ 2

z0 2 = x0 2 + y0 2
x 0 + y 0 − z 0 + 1 = 0.

3. The first three equations contain the variable λ 2. Solving the third equation for λ 2 and replacing into
the first and second equations reduces the number of equations to four:

2x 0 = 2λ 1 x 0 − 2λ 1 z 0 − 2z 0
2y 0 = 2λ 1 y 0 − 2λ 1 z 0 − 2z 0

z0 2 = x0 2 + y0 2
x 0 + y 0 − z 0 + 1 = 0.

x +z

Next, we solve the first and second equation for λ 1. The first equation gives λ 1 = x 0 − z 0 , the second

2y 0 z 0 − 2x 0 z 0 = 0
2z 0 (y 0 − x 0) = 0.
Therefore, either z 0 = 0 or y 0 = x 0. If z 0 = 0, then the first constraint becomes 0 = x 0 2 + y 0 2.
The only real solution to this equation is x 0 = 0 and y 0 = 0, which gives the ordered triple (0, 0, 0).
This point does not satisfy the second constraint, so it is not a solution.
Next, we consider y 0 = x 0, which reduces the number of equations to three:

y0 = x0

z0 2 = x0 2 + y0 2
x 0 + y 0 − z 0 + 1 = 0.
We substitute the first equation into the second and third equations:

z0 2 = x0 2 + x0 2
x 0 + x 0 − z 0 + 1 = 0.
Then, we solve the second equation for z 0, which gives z 0 = 2x 0 + 1. We then substitute this into the
first equation,

z 0 2 = 2x 0 2
⎛
⎝

2x 0 + 1⎞⎠ 2 = 2x 0 2

4x 0 2 + 4x 0 + 1 = 2x 0 2
2x 0 2 + 4x 0 + 1 = 0,

and use the quadratic formula to solve for x 0 :

KEY CONCEPTS
4.1 Functions of Several Variables
• The graph of a function of two variables is a surface in ℝ 3 and can be studied using level curves and vertical traces.
• A set of level curves is called a contour map.

4.2 Limits and Continuity
• To study limits and continuity for functions of two variables, we use a δ disk centered around a given point.
• A function of several variables has a limit if for any point in a δ ball centered at a point P, the value of the
function at that point is arbitrarily close to a fixed value (the limit value).
• The limit laws established for a function of one variable have natural extensions to functions of more than one
variable.
• A function of two variables is continuous at a point if the limit exists at that point, the function exists at that point,
and the limit and function are equal at that point.

4.3 Partial Derivatives
• A partial derivative is a derivative involving a function of more than one independent variable.
• To calculate a partial derivative with respect to a given variable, treat all the other variables as constants and use the
usual differentiation rules.
• Higher-order partial derivatives can be calculated in the same way as higher-order derivatives.

4.4 Tangent Planes and Linear Approximations
• The analog of a tangent line to a curve is a tangent plane to a surface for functions of two variables.
• Tangent planes can be used to approximate values of functions near known values.
• A function is differentiable at a point if it is ”smooth” at that point (i.e., no corners or discontinuities exist at that
point).
• The total differential can be used to approximate the change in a function z = f (x 0, y 0) at the point (x 0, y 0) for
given values of Δx and Δy.

4.5 The Chain Rule
• The chain rule for functions of more than one variable involves the partial derivatives with respect to all the
independent variables.
• Tree diagrams are useful for deriving formulas for the chain rule for functions of more than one variable, where
each independent variable also depends on other variables.

4.6 Directional Derivatives and the Gradient
• A directional derivative represents a rate of change of a function in any given direction.
• The gradient can be used in a formula to calculate the directional derivative.
• The gradient indicates the direction of greatest change of a function of more than one variable.

4.7 Maxima/Minima Problems
• A critical point of the function f (x, y) is any point (x 0, y 0) where either f x (x 0, y 0) = f y (x 0, y 0) = 0, or at
least one of f x (x 0, y 0) and f y (x 0, y 0) do not exist.
• A saddle point is a point (x 0, y 0) where f x (x 0, y 0) = f y (x 0, y 0) = 0, but (x 0, y 0) is neither a maximum nor a
minimum at that point.
• To find extrema of functions of two variables, first find the critical points, then calculate the discriminant and apply
the second derivative test.

4.8 Lagrange Multipliers
• An objective function combined with one or more constraints is an example of an optimization problem.
• To solve optimization problems, we apply the method of Lagrange multipliers using a four-step problem-solving
strategy.

Introduction
In this chapter we extend the concept of a definite integral of a single variable to double and triple integrals of functions
of two and three variables, respectively. We examine applications involving integration to compute volumes, masses, and
centroids of more general regions. We will also see how the use of other coordinate systems (such as polar, cylindrical,
and spherical coordinates) makes it simpler to compute multiple integrals over some types of regions and functions. As an
example, we will use polar coordinates to find the volume of structures such as l’Hemisfèric. (See Example 5.51.)

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

In the preceding chapter, we discussed differential calculus with multiple independent variables. Now we examine integral
calculus in multiple dimensions. Just as a partial derivative allows us to differentiate a function with respect to one variable
while holding the other variables constant, we will see that an iterated integral allows us to integrate a function with respect
to one variable while holding the other variables constant.

5.1 | Double Integrals over Rectangular Regions
Learning Objectives
5.1.1 Recognize when a function of two variables is integrable over a rectangular region.
5.1.2 Recognize and use some of the properties of double integrals.
5.1.3 Evaluate a double integral over a rectangular region by writing it as an iterated integral.
5.1.4 Use a double integral to calculate the area of a region, volume under a surface, or average
value of a function over a plane region.
In this section we investigate double integrals and show how we can use them to find the volume of a solid over a
rectangular region in the xy -plane. Many of the properties of double integrals are similar to those we have already
discussed for single integrals.

Volumes and Double Integrals
We begin by considering the space above a rectangular region R. Consider a continuous function f (x, y) ≥ 0 of two
variables defined on the closed rectangle R:
⎧

R = [a, b] × [c, d] = ⎨⎩(x, y) ∈ ℝ 2 |a ≤ x ≤ b, c ≤ y ≤ d

⎫
⎬
⎭

Here [a, b] × [c, d] denotes the Cartesian product of the two closed intervals [a, b] and [c, d]. It consists of rectangular
pairs (x, y) such that a ≤ x ≤ b and c ≤ y ≤ d. The graph of f represents a surface above the xy -plane with equation

z = f (x, y) where z is the height of the surface at the point (x, y). Let S be the solid that lies above R and under the
graph of f (Figure 5.2). The base of the solid is the rectangle R in the xy -plane. We want to find the volume V of the
solid S.

Figure 5.2 The graph of f (x, y) over the rectangle R in the

xy -plane is a curved surface.

We divide the region R into small rectangles R i j, each with area ΔA and with sides Δx and Δy (Figure 5.3). We

do this by dividing the interval [a, b] into m subintervals and dividing the interval [c, d] into n subintervals. Hence

− a , Δy = d − c , and ΔA = ΔxΔy.

Figure 5.3 Rectangle R is divided into small rectangles R i j, each with area ΔA.

The volume of a thin rectangular box above R i j is f (x*i j , y*i j )ΔA, where (x*i j , y*i j ) is an arbitrary sample point in each

R i j as shown in the following figure.

Using the same idea for all the subrectangles, we obtain an approximate volume of the solid

as

V ≈ ∑ ∑ f (x*i j , y*i j )ΔA. This sum is known as a double Riemann sum and can be used to approximate the value
i=1 j=1

of the volume of the solid. Here the double sum means that for each subrectangle we evaluate the function at the chosen
point, multiply by the area of each rectangle, and then add all the results.
As we have seen in the single-variable case, we obtain a better approximation to the actual volume if m and n become larger.

Note that the sum approaches a limit in either case and the limit is the volume of the solid with the base R. Now we are
ready to define the double integral.

i=1 j=1

If f (x, y) ≥ 0, then the volume V of the solid S, which lies above R in the xy -plane and under the graph of f, is the
double integral of the function f (x, y) over the rectangle R. If the function is ever negative, then the double integral can
be considered a “signed” volume in a manner similar to the way we defined net signed area in The Definite Integral
(http://cnx.org/content/m53631/latest/) .

Example 5.1
Setting up a Double Integral and Approximating It by Double Sums
Consider the function z = f (x, y) = 3x 2 − y over the rectangular region R = [0, 2] × [0, 2] (Figure 5.5).
a. Set up a double integral for finding the value of the signed volume of the solid S that lies above R and
“under” the graph of f .
b. Divide R into four squares with m = n = 2, and choose the sample point as the upper right corner point
of each square (1, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), and (2, 2) (Figure 5.6) to approximate the signed volume of the
solid S that lies above R and “under” the graph of f .
c. Divide R into four squares with m = n = 2, and choose the sample point as the midpoint of each square:

(1/2, 1/2), (3/2, 1/2), (1/2, 3/2), and (3/2, 3/2) to approximate the signed volume.

Solution
a. As we can see, the function z = f (x, y) = 3x 2 − y is above the plane. To find the signed volume of S,
we need to divide the region R into small rectangles R i j, each with area ΔA and with sides Δx and

Δy, and choose (x*i j , y*i j ) as sample points in each R i j. Hence, a double integral is set up as

Analysis
Notice that the approximate answers differ due to the choices of the sample points. In either case, we are
introducing some error because we are using only a few sample points. Thus, we need to investigate how we can
achieve an accurate answer.

5.1

Use the same function z = f (x, y) = 3x 2 − y over the rectangular region R = [0, 2] × [0, 2].

Divide R into the same four squares with m = n = 2, and choose the sample points as the upper left corner
point of each square (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2) (Figure 5.6) to approximate the signed volume of the
solid S that lies above R and “under” the graph of f .
Note that we developed the concept of double integral using a rectangular region R. This concept can be extended to any
general region. However, when a region is not rectangular, the subrectangles may not all fit perfectly into R, particularly if
the base area is curved. We examine this situation in more detail in the next section, where we study regions that are not
always rectangular and subrectangles may not fit perfectly in the region R. Also, the heights may not be exact if the surface
z = f (x, y) is curved. However, the errors on the sides and the height where the pieces may not fit perfectly within the
solid S approach 0 as m and n approach infinity. Also, the double integral of the function z = f (x, y) exists provided that
the function f is not too discontinuous. If the function is bounded and continuous over R except on a finite number of
smooth curves, then the double integral exists and we say that f is integrable over R.
Since ΔA = ΔxΔy = ΔyΔx, we can express dA as dx dy or dy dx. This means that, when we are using rectangular
coordinates, the double integral over a region R denoted by ∬ f (x, y)dA can be written as ∬ f (x, y)dx dy or

Now let’s list some of the properties that can be helpful to compute double integrals.

Properties of Double Integrals
The properties of double integrals are very helpful when computing them or otherwise working with them. We list here six
properties of double integrals. Properties 1 and 2 are referred to as the linearity of the integral, property 3 is the additivity of
the integral, property 4 is the monotonicity of the integral, and property 5 is used to find the bounds of the integral. Property
6 is used if f (x, y) is a product of two functions g(x) and h(y).

Theorem 5.1: Properties of Double Integrals
Assume that the functions f (x, y) and g(x, y) are integrable over the rectangular region R; S and T are subregions of
R; and assume that m and M are real numbers.
i. The sum f (x, y) + g(x, y) is integrable and

∬ ⎡⎣ f (x, y) + g(x, y)⎤⎦dA = ∬ f (x, y)dA + ∬ g(x, y)dA.

iv. If f (x, y) ≥ g(x, y) for (x, y) in R, then

vi. In the case where f (x, y) can be factored as a product of a function g(x) of x only and a function h(y) of

y only, then over the region R = (x, y)|a ≤ x ≤ b, c ≤ y ≤ d , the double integral can be written as

These properties are used in the evaluation of double integrals, as we will see later. We will become skilled in using these
properties once we become familiar with the computational tools of double integrals. So let’s get to that now.

Iterated Integrals
So far, we have seen how to set up a double integral and how to obtain an approximate value for it. We can also imagine that
evaluating double integrals by using the definition can be a very lengthy process if we choose larger values for m and n.
Therefore, we need a practical and convenient technique for computing double integrals. In other words, we need to learn
how to compute double integrals without employing the definition that uses limits and double sums.
The basic idea is that the evaluation becomes easier if we can break a double integral into single integrals by integrating
first with respect to one variable and then with respect to the other. The key tool we need is called an iterated integral.

tool for evaluating double integrals.

Fubini’s theorem offers an easier way to evaluate the double integral by the use of an iterated integral. Note how
the boundary values of the region R become the upper and lower limits of integration.

The double integration in this example is simple enough to use Fubini’s theorem directly, allowing us to convert a double
integral into an iterated integral. Consequently, we are now ready to convert all double integrals to iterated integrals and
demonstrate how the properties listed earlier can help us evaluate double integrals when the function f (x, y) is more
complex. Note that the order of integration can be changed (see Example 5.7).

Applications of Double Integrals
Double integrals are very useful for finding the area of a region bounded by curves of functions. We describe this situation
in more detail in the next section. However, if the region is a rectangular shape, we can find its area by integrating the
constant function f (x, y) = 1 over the region R.

Definition
The area of the region R is given by A(R) = ∬ 1dA.
R

This definition makes sense because using f (x, y) = 1 and evaluating the integral make it a product of length and width.
Let’s check this formula with an example and see how this works.

We have already seen how double integrals can be used to find the volume of a solid bounded above by a function f (x, y)
over a region R provided f (x, y) ≥ 0 for all (x, y) in R. Here is another example to illustrate this concept.

Example 5.9
Volume of an Elliptic Paraboloid
Find the volume V of the solid S that is bounded by the elliptic paraboloid 2x 2 + y 2 + z = 27, the planes

x = 3 and y = 3, and the three coordinate planes.
Solution
First notice the graph of the surface z = 27 − 2x 2 − y 2 in Figure 5.9(a) and above the square region

R 1 = [−3, 3] × [−3, 3]. However, we need the volume of the solid bounded by the elliptic paraboloid
2x 2 + y 2 + z = 27, the planes x = 3 and y = 3, and the three coordinate planes.

Figure 5.9 (a) The surface z = 27 − 2x 2 − y 2 above the square region R 1 = [−3, 3] × [−3, 3]. (b) The
solid S lies under the surface z = 27 − 2x 2 − y 2 above the square region R 2 = [0, 3] × [0, 3].

Now let’s look at the graph of the surface in Figure 5.9(b). We determine the volume V by evaluating the double
integral over R 2 :

Recall that we defined the average value of a function of one variable on an interval [a, b] as
b

f ave = 1 ∫ f (x)dx.
b−a a
Similarly, we can define the average value of a function of two variables over a region R. The main difference is that we
divide by an area instead of the width of an interval.

Definition
The average value of a function of two variables over a region R is

f ave =

(5.4)

In the next example we find the average value of a function over a rectangular region. This is a good example of obtaining
useful information for an integration by making individual measurements over a grid, instead of trying to find an algebraic
expression for a function.

Hurricane Karl, which dumped 4–8 inches (100–200 mm) of rain in some parts of the Midwest on September
22–23, 2010. The area of rainfall measured 300 miles east to west and 250 miles north to south. Estimate the

quadrant and hence all are positive. Now divide the entire map into six rectangles (m = 2 and n = 3), as shown
in Figure 5.11. Assume f (x, y) denotes the storm rainfall in inches at a point approximately x miles to the
east of the origin and y miles to the north of the origin. Let R represent the entire area of 250 × 300 = 75000
square miles. Then the area of each subrectangle is

ΔA = 1 (75000) = 12500.
6
Assume (x*i j , y*i j ) are approximately the midpoints of each subrectangle R i j. Note the color-coded region at
each of these points, and estimate the rainfall. The rainfall at each of these points can be estimated as:
At (x 11, y 11) the rainfall is 0.08.
At (x 12, y 12) the rainfall is 0.08.
At (x 13, y 13) the rainfall is 0.01.
At (x 21, y 21) the rainfall is 1.70.
At (x 22, y 22) the rainfall is 1.74.
At (x 23, y 23) the rainfall is 3.00.

5.2 | Double Integrals over General Regions
Learning Objectives
5.2.1 Recognize when a function of two variables is integrable over a general region.
5.2.2 Evaluate a double integral by computing an iterated integral over a region bounded by two
vertical lines and two functions of x, or two horizontal lines and two functions of y.
5.2.3 Simplify the calculation of an iterated integral by changing the order of integration.
5.2.4 Use double integrals to calculate the volume of a region between two surfaces or the area
of a plane region.
5.2.5 Solve problems involving double improper integrals.
In Double Integrals over Rectangular Regions, we studied the concept of double integrals and examined the tools
needed to compute them. We learned techniques and properties to integrate functions of two variables over rectangular
regions. We also discussed several applications, such as finding the volume bounded above by a function over a rectangular
region, finding area by integration, and calculating the average value of a function of two variables.
In this section we consider double integrals of functions defined over a general bounded region D on the plane. Most of
the previous results hold in this situation as well, but some techniques need to be extended to cover this more general case.

General Regions of Integration
An example of a general bounded region D on a plane is shown in Figure 5.12. Since D is bounded on the plane, there
must exist a rectangular region R on the same plane that encloses the region D, that is, a rectangular region R exists
such that D is a subset of R(D ⊆ R).

Figure 5.12 For a region D that is a subset of R, we can
define a function g(x, y) to equal f (x, y) at every point in D
and 0 at every point of R not in D.

Suppose z = f (x, y) is defined on a general planar bounded region D as in Figure 5.12. In order to develop double
integrals of f over D, we extend the definition of the function to include all points on the rectangular region R and then
use the concepts and tools from the preceding section. But how do we extend the definition of f to include all the points
on R ? We do this by defining a new function g(x, y) on R as follows:
⎧ f (x, y) if (x, y) is in D
g(x, y) = ⎨
⎩0
if (x, y) is in R but not in D

Note that we might have some technical difficulties if the boundary of D is complicated. So we assume the boundary to
be a piecewise smooth and continuous simple closed curve. Also, since all the results developed in Double Integrals
over Rectangular Regions used an integrable function f (x, y), we must be careful about g(x, y) and verify that

502

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

g(x, y) is an integrable function over the rectangular region R. This happens as long as the region D is bounded by
simple closed curves. For now we will concentrate on the descriptions of the regions rather than the function and extend our
theory appropriately for integration.
We consider two types of planar bounded regions.

Definition
A region D in the (x, y) -plane is of Type I if it lies between two vertical lines and the graphs of two continuous
functions g 1 (x) and g 2 (x). That is (Figure 5.13),

D = (x, y)|a ≤ x ≤ b, g 1 (x) ≤ y ≤ g 2 (x) .
⎧
⎨
⎩

⎫
⎬
⎭

A region D in the xy plane is of Type II if it lies between two horizontal lines and the graphs of two continuous
functions h 1 (y) and h 2 (y). That is (Figure 5.14),

D = (x, y)|c ≤ y ≤ d, h 1 (y) ≤ x ≤ h 2 (y) .
⎧
⎨
⎩

⎫
⎬
⎭

Figure 5.13 A Type I region lies between two vertical lines and the graphs of two functions of x.

Figure 5.14 A Type II region lies between two horizontal lines and the graphs of two
functions of y.

Example 5.11
Describing a Region as Type I and Also as Type II
Consider the region in the first quadrant between the functions y = x and y = x 3 (Figure 5.15). Describe the
region first as Type I and then as Type II.

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

503

Figure 5.15 Region D can be described as Type I or as Type
II.

Solution
When describing a region as Type I, we need to identify the function that lies above the region and the function
that lies below the region. Here, region D is bounded above by y = x and below by y = x 3 in the interval for
⎧

⎫

x in [0, 1]. Hence, as Type I, D is described as the set ⎨⎩(x, y)|0 ≤ x ≤ 1, x 3 ≤ y ≤ x⎬⎭.
However, when describing a region as Type II, we need to identify the function that lies on the left of the region
and the function that lies on the right of the region. Here, the region D is bounded on the left by x = y 2
and on the right by x = 3 y in the interval for y in [0, 1]. Hence, as Type II, D is described as the set
⎧
⎨
⎩

⎫

(x, y)|0 ≤ y ≤ 1, y 2 ≤ x ≤ 3 y⎬⎭.

5.7

Consider the region in the first quadrant between the functions y = 2x and y = x 2. Describe the region

first as Type I and then as Type II.

Double Integrals over Nonrectangular Regions
To develop the concept and tools for evaluation of a double integral over a general, nonrectangular region, we need to first
understand the region and be able to express it as Type I or Type II or a combination of both. Without understanding the
regions, we will not be able to decide the limits of integrations in double integrals. As a first step, let us look at the following
theorem.

Theorem 5.3: Double Integrals over Nonrectangular Regions
Suppose g(x, y) is the extension to the rectangle R of the function f (x, y) defined on the regions D and R as
shown in Figure 5.12 inside R. Then g(x, y) is integrable and we define the double integral of f (x, y) over D by

∬ f (x, y)dA = ∬ g(x, y)dA.
D

R

The right-hand side of this equation is what we have seen before, so this theorem is reasonable because R is a rectangle
and ∬ g(x, y)dA has been discussed in the preceding section. Also, the equality works because the values of g(x, y)

are 0 for any point (x, y) that lies outside D, and hence these points do not add anything to the integral. However, it is
important that the rectangle R contains the region D.

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

As a matter of fact, if the region D is bounded by smooth curves on a plane and we are able to describe it as Type I or Type
II or a mix of both, then we can use the following theorem and not have to find a rectangle R containing the region.

The integral in each of these expressions is an iterated integral, similar to those we have seen before. Notice that, in the
inner integral in the first expression, we integrate f (x, y) with x being held constant and the limits of integration being

g 1 (x) and g 2 (x). In the inner integral in the second expression, we integrate f (x, y) with y being held constant and the

limits of integration are h 1 (x) and h 2 (x).

Recall from Double Integrals over Rectangular Regions the properties of double integrals. As we have seen from
the examples here, all these properties are also valid for a function defined on a nonrectangular bounded region on a plane.
In particular, property 3 states:

Theorem 5.5: Decomposing Regions into Smaller Regions
Suppose the region D can be expressed as D = D 1 ∪ D 2 where D 1 and D 2 do not overlap except at their

This theorem is particularly useful for nonrectangular regions because it allows us to split a region into a union of regions
of Type I and Type II. Then we can compute the double integral on each piece in a convenient way, as in the next example.

Example 5.14
Decomposing Regions
Express the region D shown in Figure 5.19 as a union of regions of Type I or Type II, and evaluate the integral

∬ ⎛⎝2x + 5y⎞⎠dA.

Figure 5.19 This region can be decomposed into a union of
three regions of Type I or Type II.

Solution
The region D is not easy to decompose into any one type; it is actually a combination of different types. So we
⎧

⎫

can write it as a union of three regions D 1, D 2, and D 3 where, D 1 = ⎨⎩(x, y)| − 2 ≤ x ≤ 0, 0 ≤ y ≤ (x + 2) 2⎬⎭,

Changing the Order of Integration
As we have already seen when we evaluate an iterated integral, sometimes one order of integration leads to a computation
that is significantly simpler than the other order of integration. Sometimes the order of integration does not matter, but it is
important to learn to recognize when a change in order will simplify our work.

We can see from the limits of integration that the region is bounded above by y = 2 − x 2 and below by y = 0,

where x is in the interval ⎡⎣0, 2⎤⎦. By reversing the order, we have the region bounded on the left by x = 0 and
on the right by x = 2 − y where y is in the interval [0, 2]. We solved y = 2 − x 2 in terms of x to obtain

The solid is a tetrahedron with the base on the xy -plane and a height z = 6 − 2x − 3y. The base is the region D
bounded by the lines, x = 0, y = 0 and 2x + 3y = 6 where z = 0 (Figure 5.23). Note that we can consider
the region D as Type I or as Type II, and we can integrate in both ways.

Finding the area of a rectangular region is easy, but finding the area of a nonrectangular region is not so easy. As we have
seen, we can use double integrals to find a rectangular area. As a matter of fact, this comes in very handy for finding the
area of a general nonrectangular region, as stated in the next definition.

In this section we would like to deal with improper integrals of functions over rectangles or simple regions such that f has

In some situations in probability theory, we can gain insight into a problem when we are able to use double integrals over
general regions. Before we go over an example with a double integral, we need to set a few definitions and become familiar
with some important properties.

Definition
Consider a pair of continuous random variables X and Y, such as the birthdays of two people or the number of
sunny and rainy days in a month. The joint density function f of X and Y satisfies the probability that (X, Y) lies
in a certain region D:

P⎛⎝(X, Y) ∈ D⎞⎠ = ∬ f (x, y)dA.
D

Since the probabilities can never be negative and must lie between 0 and 1, the joint density function satisfies the
following inequality and equation:

f (x, y) ≥ 0 and ∬ f (x, y)dA = 1.
R2

Definition
The variables X and Y are said to be independent random variables if their joint density function is the product of
their individual density functions:

f (x, y) = f 1 (x) f 2 (y).

Example 5.22
Application to Probability
At Sydney’s Restaurant, customers must wait an average of 15 minutes for a table. From the time they are seated
until they have finished their meal requires an additional 40 minutes, on average. What is the probability that a
customer spends less than an hour and a half at the diner, assuming that waiting for a table and completing the
meal are independent events?

Solution
Waiting times are mathematically modeled by exponential density functions, with m being the average waiting
time, as
⎧0
if t < 0,
f (t) = ⎨ 1 −t/m
if t ≥ 0.
⎩m e

If X and Y are random variables for ‘waiting for a table’ and ‘completing the meal,’ then the probability density
functions are, respectively,

if y < 0,
⎧0
⎧0
if x < 0,
f 1(x) = ⎨ 1 −x/15
and f 2(y) = ⎨ 1 −y/40
if x ≥ 0.
if y ≥ 0.
⎩15 e
⎩40 e

Clearly, the events are independent and hence the joint density function is the product of the individual functions

if x < 0 or y < 0,
⎧0
f (x, y) = f 1(x) f 2(y) = ⎨ 1 −x/15 −y/60
e
if x, y ≥ 0.
⎩600 e

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

We want to find the probability that the combined time X + Y is less than 90 minutes. In terms of geometry, it
means that the region D is in the first quadrant bounded by the line x + y = 90 (Figure 5.27).

Figure 5.27 The region of integration for a joint probability
density function.

Hence, the probability that (X, Y) is in the region D is

P(X + Y ≤ 90) = P⎛⎝(X, Y) ∈ D⎞⎠ = ∬ f (x, y)dA = ∬

1 e −x/15 e −y/40 dA.

D 600

D

Since x + y = 90 is the same as y = 90 − x, we have a region of Type I, so

D = (x, y)|0 ≤ x ≤ 90, 0 ≤ y ≤ 90 − x ,
⎧

Thus, there is an 83.2% chance that a customer spends less than an hour and a half at the restaurant.

Another important application in probability that can involve improper double integrals is the calculation of expected
values. First we define this concept and then show an example of a calculation.

Definition
In probability theory, we denote the expected values E(X) and E(Y), respectively, as the most likely outcomes of
the events. The expected values E(X) and E(Y) are given by

E(X) = ∬ x f (x, y)dA and E(Y) = ∬ y f (x, y)dA,

5.3 | Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates
Learning Objectives
5.3.1 Recognize the format of a double integral over a polar rectangular region.
5.3.2 Evaluate a double integral in polar coordinates by using an iterated integral.
5.3.3 Recognize the format of a double integral over a general polar region.
5.3.4 Use double integrals in polar coordinates to calculate areas and volumes.
Double integrals are sometimes much easier to evaluate if we change rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. However,
before we describe how to make this change, we need to establish the concept of a double integral in a polar rectangular
region.

Polar Rectangular Regions of Integration
When we defined the double integral for a continuous function in rectangular coordinates—say, g over a region R in the

xy -plane—we divided R into subrectangles with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. These sides have either constant
x -values and/or constant y -values. In polar coordinates, the shape we work with is a polar rectangle, whose sides have
constant r -values and/or constant θ -values. This means we can describe a polar rectangle as in Figure 5.28(a), with

R = (r, θ)|a ≤ r ≤ b, α ≤ θ ≤ β .
⎫
⎬
⎭

⎧
⎨
⎩

In this section, we are looking to integrate over polar rectangles. Consider a function f (r, θ) over a polar rectangle R. We
divide the interval ⎡⎣a, b⎤⎦ into m subintervals [r i − 1, r i] of length Δr = (b − a)/m and divide the interval ⎡⎣α, β⎤⎦ into n

subintervals ⎡⎣θ i − 1, θ i⎤⎦ of width Δθ = ⎛⎝β − α⎞⎠/n. This means that the circles r = r i and rays θ = θ i for 1 ≤ i ≤ m and

1 ≤ j ≤ n divide the polar rectangle R into smaller polar subrectangles R i j (Figure 5.28(b)).

Figure 5.28 (a) A polar rectangle R (b) divided into subrectangles R i j. (c) Close-up of a subrectangle.

As before, we need to find the area ΔA of the polar subrectangle R i j and the “polar” volume of the thin box above R i j.
Recall that, in a circle of radius r, the length s of an arc subtended by a central angle of θ radians is s = rθ. Notice that
the polar rectangle R i j looks a lot like a trapezoid with parallel sides r i − 1 Δθ and r i Δθ and with a width Δr. Hence
the area of the polar subrectangle R i j is

ΔA = 1 Δr⎛⎝r i − 1 Δθ + r 1 Δθ⎞⎠.
2
Simplifying and letting r*i j = 1 (r i − 1 + r i), we have ΔA = r*i j ΔrΔθ. Therefore, the polar volume of the thin box

Using the same idea for all the subrectangles and summing the volumes of the rectangular boxes, we obtain a double
Riemann sum as

As we have seen before, we obtain a better approximation to the polar volume of the solid above the region R when we let
m and n become larger. Hence, we define the polar volume as the limit of the double Riemann sum,

Again, just as in Double Integrals over Rectangular Regions, the double integral over a polar rectangular region can
be expressed as an iterated integral in polar coordinates. Hence,

θ=αr=a

Notice that the expression for dA is replaced by r dr dθ when working in polar coordinates. Another way to look at the
polar double integral is to change the double integral in rectangular coordinates by substitution. When the function f is
given in terms of x and y, using x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ, and dA = r dr dθ changes it to

∬ f (x, y)dA = ∬ f (r cos θ, r sin θ)r dr dθ.

Note that all the properties listed in Double Integrals over Rectangular Regions for the double integral in rectangular
coordinates hold true for the double integral in polar coordinates as well, so we can use them without hesitation.

Example 5.24
Sketching a Polar Rectangular Region
Sketch the polar rectangular region R = {(r, θ)|1 ≤ r ≤ 3, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π}.

Solution
As we can see from Figure 5.30, r = 1 and r = 3 are circles of radius 1 and 3 and 0 ≤ θ ≤ π covers the
entire top half of the plane. Hence the region R looks like a semicircular band.

semicircles.

Now that we have sketched a polar rectangular region, let us demonstrate how to evaluate a double integral over this region
by using polar coordinates.

General Polar Regions of Integration
To evaluate the double integral of a continuous function by iterated integrals over general polar regions, we consider two
types of regions, analogous to Type I and Type II as discussed for rectangular coordinates in Double Integrals over
General Regions. It is more common to write polar equations as r = f (θ) than θ = f (r), so we describe a general
polar region as R = (r, θ)|α ≤ θ ≤ β, h 1 (θ) ≤ r ≤ h 2 (θ) (see the following figure).

Polar Areas and Volumes
As in rectangular coordinates, if a solid S is bounded by the surface z = f (r, θ),

as well as by the surfaces

r = a, r = b, θ = α, and θ = β, we can find the volume V of S by double integration, as

(x − 1) 2 + y 2 = 1 on the xy -plane. See the paraboloid in Figure 5.35 intersecting the cylinder
(x − 1) 2 + y 2 = 1 above the xy -plane.

Figure 5.35 Finding the volume of a solid with a paraboloid
cap and a circular base.

Solution
First change the disk (x − 1) 2 + y 2 = 1 to polar coordinates. Expanding the square term, we have

x 2 − 2x + 1 + y 2 = 1. Then simplify to get x 2 + y 2 = 2x, which in polar coordinates becomes r 2 = 2r cos θ
and then either r = 0 or r = 2 cos θ. Similarly, the equation of the paraboloid changes to z = 4 − r 2.
Therefore we can describe the disk (x − 1) 2 + y 2 = 1 on the xy -plane as the region

D = {(r, θ)|0 ≤ θ ≤ π, 0 ≤ r ≤ 2 cos θ}.
Hence the volume of the solid bounded above by the paraboloid z = 4 − x 2 − y 2 and below by r = 2 cos θ is

Notice in the next example that integration is not always easy with polar coordinates. Complexity of integration depends
on the function and also on the region over which we need to perform the integration. If the region has a more natural
expression in polar coordinates or if f has a simpler antiderivative in polar coordinates, then the change in polar
coordinates is appropriate; otherwise, use rectangular coordinates.

To answer the question of how the formulas for the volumes of different standard solids such as a sphere, a cone, or a
cylinder are found, we want to demonstrate an example and find the volume of an arbitrary cone.

Example 5.32
Finding a Volume Using a Double Integral
Use polar coordinates to find the volume inside the cone z = 2 − x 2 + y 2 and above the xy-plane.

Solution
The region D for the integration is the base of the cone, which appears to be a circle on the xy-plane (see the
following figure).

Figure 5.37 Finding the volume of a solid inside the cone and above
the xy -plane.

536

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

We find the equation of the circle by setting z = 0:

0 = 2 − x2 + y2
2 =

x2 + y2

x 2 + y 2 = 4.

This means the radius of the circle is 2, so for the integration we have 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π and 0 ≤ r ≤ 2. Substituting

x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ in the equation z = 2 − x 2 + y 2 we have z = 2 − r. Therefore, the volume of
the cone is
θ = 2π r = 2

∫

∫ (2 − r)r dr dθ = 2π 43 = 8π
cubic units.

θ=0 r=0

Analysis
Note that if we were to find the volume of an arbitrary cone with radius a units and height h units, then the

equation of the cone would be z = h − h

We can still use Figure 5.37 and set up the integral as

5.20 Use polar coordinates to find an iterated integral for finding the volume of the solid enclosed by the
paraboloids z = x 2 + y 2 and z = 16 − x 2 − y 2.
As with rectangular coordinates, we can also use polar coordinates to find areas of certain regions using a double integral.
As before, we need to understand the region whose area we want to compute. Sketching a graph and identifying the region
can be helpful to realize the limits of integration. Generally, the area formula in double integration will look like
β h 2 (θ)

Area A = ∫

Example 5.33
Finding an Area Using a Double Integral in Polar Coordinates

Solution
Sketching the graph of the function r = cos 4θ reveals that it is a polar rose with eight petals (see the following

Figure 5.38 Finding the area of a polar rose with eight petals.

Using symmetry, we can see that we need to find the area of one petal and then multiply it by 8. Notice that
the values of θ for which the graph passes through the origin are the zeros of the function cos 4θ, and these
are odd multiples of π/8. Thus, one of the petals corresponds to the values of θ in the interval [−π/8, π/8].
Therefore, the area bounded by the curve r = cos 4θ is

We can from see the symmetry of the graph that we need to find the points of intersection. Setting the two
equations equal to each other gives

3 cos θ = 1 + cos θ.
One of the points of intersection is θ = π/3. The area above the polar axis consists of two parts, with one
part defined by the cardioid from θ = 0 to θ = π/3 and the other part defined by the circle from θ = π/3 to
θ = π/2. By symmetry, the total area is twice the area above the polar axis. Thus, we have

Learning Objectives
5.4.1 Recognize when a function of three variables is integrable over a rectangular box.
5.4.2 Evaluate a triple integral by expressing it as an iterated integral.
5.4.3 Recognize when a function of three variables is integrable over a closed and bounded
region.
5.4.4 Simplify a calculation by changing the order of integration of a triple integral.
5.4.5 Calculate the average value of a function of three variables.
In Double Integrals over Rectangular Regions, we discussed the double integral of a function f (x, y) of two
variables over a rectangular region in the plane. In this section we define the triple integral of a function f (x, y, z) of three
variables over a rectangular solid box in space, ℝ 3. Later in this section we extend the definition to more general regions

in ℝ 3.

Integrable Functions of Three Variables
We can define a rectangular box B in ℝ 3 as B = (x, y, z)|a ≤ x ≤ b, c ≤ y ≤ d, e ≤ z ≤ f . We follow a similar

procedure to what we did in Double Integrals over Rectangular Regions. We divide the interval [a, b] into l

x − xi − 1
subintervals [x i − 1, x i] of equal length Δx = i
, divide the interval [c, d] into m subintervals [y i − 1, y i]

if this limit exists.
When the triple integral exists on B, the function f (x, y, z) is said to be integrable on B. Also, the triple integral exists
if f (x, y, z) is continuous on B. Therefore, we will use continuous functions for our examples. However, continuity is
sufficient but not necessary; in other words, f is bounded on B and continuous except possibly on the boundary of B.

548

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

The sample point (x*i jk, y*i jk, z*i jk) can be any point in the rectangular sub-box B i jk and all the properties of a double
integral apply to a triple integral. Just as the double integral has many practical applications, the triple integral also has
many applications, which we discuss in later sections.
Now that we have developed the concept of the triple integral, we need to know how to compute it. Just as in the case of the
double integral, we can have an iterated triple integral, and consequently, a version of Fubini’s thereom for triple integrals
exists.

Theorem 5.9: Fubini’s Theorem for Triple Integrals
If f (x, y, z) is continuous on a rectangular box B = [a, b] × [c, d] × [e, f ], then
f d b

∭ f (x, y, z)dV = ∫ ∫ ∫ f (x, y, z)dx dy dz.

This integral is also equal to any of the other five possible orderings for the iterated triple integral.

For a, b, c, d, e, and f real numbers, the iterated triple integral can be expressed in six different orderings:

For a rectangular box, the order of integration does not make any significant difference in the level of difficulty in
computation. We compute triple integrals using Fubini’s Theorem rather than using the Riemann sum definition. We follow
the order of integration in the same way as we did for double integrals (that is, from inside to outside).

Triple Integrals over a General Bounded Region
We now expand the definition of the triple integral to compute a triple integral over a more general bounded region E in

ℝ 3. The general bounded regions we will consider are of three types. First, let D be the bounded region that is a projection

of E onto the xy -plane. Suppose the region E in ℝ 3 has the form

following figure.

Figure 5.42 We can describe region E as the space between
u 1(x, y) and u 2(x, y) above the projection D of E onto the

xy -plane.

Theorem 5.10: Triple Integral over a General Region

Similarly, we can consider a general bounded region D in the xy -plane and two functions y = u 1(x, z) and y = u 2(x, z)
such that u 1(x, z) ≤ u 2(x, z) for all (x, z) in D. Then we can describe the solid region E in ℝ 3 as

Finally, if D is a general bounded region in the yz -plane and we have two functions x = u 1(y, z) and x = u 2(y, z) such
that u 1(y, z) ≤ u 2(y, z) for all (y, z) in D, then the solid region E in ℝ 3 can be described as

Note that the region D in any of the planes may be of Type I or Type II as described in Double Integrals over General

Example 5.38
Evaluating a Triple Integral over a General Bounded Region
Evaluate the triple integral of the function f (x, y, z) = 5x − 3y over the solid tetrahedron bounded by the planes

x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, and x + y + z = 1.
Solution
Figure 5.45 shows the solid tetrahedron E and its projection D on the xy -plane.

Figure 5.45 The solid E has a projection D on the xy -plane of Type I.

We can describe the solid region tetrahedron as

E = (x, y, z)|0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ 1 − x, 0 ≤ z ≤ 1 − x − y .

the volume of a general solid bounded region E. The next example illustrates the method.

Example 5.39
Finding a Volume by Evaluating a Triple Integral
Find the volume of a right pyramid that has the square base in the xy -plane [−1, 1] × [−1, 1] and vertex at the
point (0, 0, 1) as shown in the following figure.

Figure 5.46 Finding the volume of a pyramid with a square base.

Solution
In this pyramid the value of z changes from 0 to 1, and at each height z, the cross section of the pyramid for
any value of z is the square [−1 + z, 1 − z] × [−1 + z, 1 − z]. Hence, the volume of the pyramid is ∭ 1dV
E

where

E = (x, y, z)|0 ≤ z ≤ 1, −1 + z ≤ y ≤ 1 − z, −1 + z ≤ x ≤ 1 − z .

that this gives the volume of a sphere using a triple integral.

Changing the Order of Integration
As we have already seen in double integrals over general bounded regions, changing the order of the integration is done
quite often to simplify the computation. With a triple integral over a rectangular box, the order of integration does not
change the level of difficulty of the calculation. However, with a triple integral over a general bounded region, choosing an
appropriate order of integration can simplify the computation quite a bit. Sometimes making the change to polar coordinates
can also be very helpful. We demonstrate two examples here.

Example 5.40
Changing the Order of Integration
Consider the iterated integral

∫

∫

∫ f (x, y, z)dz dy dx.

The order of integration here is first with respect to z, then y, and then x. Express this integral by changing the
order of integration to be first with respect to x, then z, and then y. Verify that the value of the integral is the
same if we let f (x, y, z) = xyz.

Solution
The best way to do this is to sketch the region E and its projections onto each of the three coordinate planes.
Thus, let

Average Value of a Function of Three Variables
Recall that we found the average value of a function of two variables by evaluating the double integral over a region on the
plane and then dividing by the area of the region. Similarly, we can find the average value of a function in three variables
by evaluating the triple integral over a solid region and then dividing by the volume of the solid.

Theorem 5.11: Average Value of a Function of Three Variables
If f (x, y, z) is integrable over a solid bounded region E with positive volume V(E), then the average value of the
function is

f ave =

Note that the volume is V(E) = ∭ 1dV.

is T(x, y, z) = (xy + 8z + 20)°C. Find the average temperature over the solid.

Solution
Use the theorem given above and the triple integral to find the numerator and the denominator. Then do the

division. Notice that the plane x + y + z = 1 has intercepts (1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), and (0, 0, 1). The region E
looks like

5.5 | Triple Integrals in Cylindrical and Spherical
Coordinates
Learning Objectives
5.5.1 Evaluate a triple integral by changing to cylindrical coordinates.
5.5.2 Evaluate a triple integral by changing to spherical coordinates.
Earlier in this chapter we showed how to convert a double integral in rectangular coordinates into a double integral in polar
coordinates in order to deal more conveniently with problems involving circular symmetry. A similar situation occurs with
triple integrals, but here we need to distinguish between cylindrical symmetry and spherical symmetry. In this section we
convert triple integrals in rectangular coordinates into a triple integral in either cylindrical or spherical coordinates.
Also recall the chapter opener, which showed the opera house l’Hemisphèric in Valencia, Spain. It has four sections with
one of the sections being a theater in a five-story-high sphere (ball) under an oval roof as long as a football field. Inside is
an IMAX screen that changes the sphere into a planetarium with a sky full of 9000 twinkling stars. Using triple integrals
in spherical coordinates, we can find the volumes of different geometric shapes like these.

Review of Cylindrical Coordinates
As we have seen earlier, in two-dimensional space ℝ 2, a point with rectangular coordinates (x, y) can be identified
with (r, θ) in polar coordinates and vice versa, where x = r cos θ,

y
y = r sin θ, r 2 = x 2 + y 2 and tan θ = ⎛⎝ x ⎞⎠ are the

relationships between the variables.
In three-dimensional space ℝ 3,

a point with rectangular coordinates (x, y, z) can be identified with cylindrical

coordinates (r, θ, z) and vice versa. We can use these same conversion relationships, adding z as the vertical distance to
the point from the xy -plane as shown in the following figure.

Figure 5.50 Cylindrical coordinates are similar to polar
coordinates with a vertical z coordinate added.

To convert from rectangular to cylindrical coordinates, we use the conversion x = r cos θ and y = r sin θ. To convert
⎛y ⎞

from cylindrical to rectangular coordinates, we use r 2 = x 2 + y 2 and θ = tan −1 ⎝ x ⎠. The z -coordinate remains the same
in both cases.
In the two-dimensional plane with a rectangular coordinate system, when we say x = k (constant) we mean an unbounded
vertical line parallel to the y -axis and when y = l (constant) we mean an unbounded horizontal line parallel to the x -axis.

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

567

With the polar coordinate system, when we say r = c (constant), we mean a circle of radius c units and when θ = α
(constant) we mean an infinite ray making an angle α with the positive x -axis.
Similarly, in three-dimensional space with rectangular coordinates (x, y, z), the equations x = k, y = l, and z = m,
where k, l,

and m are constants, represent unbounded planes parallel to the yz -plane, xz -plane and xy -plane,

respectively. With cylindrical coordinates (r, θ, z), by r = c, θ = α, and z = m, where c, α, and m are constants,
we mean an unbounded vertical cylinder with the z -axis as its radial axis; a plane making a constant angle α with
the xy -plane; and an unbounded horizontal plane parallel to the xy -plane, respectively. This means that the circular
cylinder x 2 + y 2 = c 2 in rectangular coordinates can be represented simply as r = c in cylindrical coordinates. (Refer to
Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates for more review.)

Integration in Cylindrical Coordinates
Triple integrals can often be more readily evaluated by using cylindrical coordinates instead of rectangular coordinates.
Some common equations of surfaces in rectangular coordinates along with corresponding equations in cylindrical
coordinates are listed in Table 5.1. These equations will become handy as we proceed with solving problems using triple
integrals.

As mentioned in the preceding section, all the properties of a double integral work well in triple integrals, whether
in rectangular coordinates or cylindrical coordinates. They also hold for iterated integrals. To reiterate, in cylindrical
coordinates, Fubini’s theorem takes the following form:

Theorem 5.12: Fubini’s Theorem in Cylindrical Coordinates

The iterated integral may be replaced equivalently by any one of the other five iterated integrals obtained by integrating
with respect to the three variables in other orders.
Cylindrical coordinate systems work well for solids that are symmetric around an axis, such as cylinders and cones. Let us
look at some examples before we define the triple integral in cylindrical coordinates on general cylindrical regions.

Consider the region E inside the right circular cylinder with equation r = 2 sin θ, bounded below by the rθ

Figure 5.52 Setting up a triple integral in cylindrical

Solution
First, identify that the equation for the sphere is r 2 + z 2 = 16. We can see that the limits for z are from 0 to

z = 16 − r 2. Then the limits for r are from 0 to r = 2 sin θ. Finally, the limits for θ are from 0 to π.
Hence the region is

Figure 5.53 Setting up a triple integral in cylindrical coordinates
over a conical region.

Solution
a. The cone is of radius 1 where it meets the paraboloid. Since z = 2 − x 2 − y 2 = 2 − r 2 and

z = x2 + y2 = r

(assuming

r

2 − r 2 = r.

is nonnegative), we have

Solving, we have

2

r + r − 2 = (r + 2)(r − 1) = 0. Since r ≥ 0, we have r = 1. Therefore z = 1. So the intersection
of these two surfaces is a circle of radius 1 in the plane z = 1. The cone is the lower bound for z and
the paraboloid is the upper bound. The projection of the region onto the xy -plane is the circle of radius

1 centered at the origin.
Thus, we can describe the region as
⎧

⎫

E = ⎨⎩(r, θ, z)|0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π, 0 ≤ r ≤ 1, r ≤ z ≤ 2 − r 2⎬⎭.
Hence the integral for the volume is

b. We can also write the cone surface as r = z and the paraboloid as r 2 = 2 − z. The lower bound for r is
zero, but the upper bound is sometimes the cone and the other times it is the paraboloid. The plane z = 1
divides the region into two regions. Then the region can be described as

E = {(r, θ, z)|0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π, 0 ≤ z ≤ 1, 0 ≤ r ≤ z}

positive z-axis and the line OP (Figure 5.55). Note that ρ ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ φ ≤ π. (Refer to Cylindrical and Spherical
Coordinates for a review.) Spherical coordinates are useful for triple integrals over regions that are symmetric with

Integration in Spherical Coordinates
We now establish a triple integral in the spherical coordinate system, as we did before in the cylindrical coordinate system.
Let the function f ⎛⎝ρ, θ, φ⎞⎠ be continuous in a bounded spherical box, B = ⎛⎝ρ, θ, φ⎞⎠|a ≤ ρ ≤ b, α ≤ θ ≤ β, γ ≤ φ ≤ ψ .

Now we can illustrate the following theorem for triple integrals in spherical coordinates with (ρ*i jk, θ*i jk, φ*i jk) being any
sample point in the spherical subbox B i jk. For the volume element of the subbox ΔV in spherical coordinates, we have

ΔV = ⎛⎝Δρ⎞⎠⎛⎝ρΔφ⎞⎠⎛⎝ρ sin φΔθ⎞⎠, , as shown in the following figure.

As with the other multiple integrals we have examined, all the properties work similarly for a triple integral in the spherical

This iterated integral may be replaced by other iterated integrals by integrating with respect to the three variables in
other orders.

As stated before, spherical coordinate systems work well for solids that are symmetric around a point, such as spheres
and cones. Let us look at some examples before we consider triple integrals in spherical coordinates on general spherical
regions.

The concept of triple integration in spherical coordinates can be extended to integration over a general solid, using the
projections onto the coordinate planes. Note that dV and dA mean the increments in volume and area, respectively. The
variables V and A are used as the variables for integration to express the integrals.
The triple integral of a continuous function f ⎛⎝ρ, θ, φ⎞⎠ over a general solid region

Example 5.48
Setting up a Triple Integral in Spherical Coordinates
Set up an integral for the volume of the region bounded by the cone z = 3⎛⎝x 2 + y 2⎞⎠ and the hemisphere

z = 4 − x 2 − y 2 (see the figure below).

Figure 5.58 A region bounded below by a cone and above by
a hemisphere.

Solution
Using the conversion formulas from rectangular coordinates to spherical coordinates, we have:
For the cone: z = 3⎛⎝x 2 + y 2⎞⎠ or ρ cos φ = 3ρ sin φ or tan φ = 1 or φ = π .

6

For the sphere: z = 4 − x 2 − y 2 or z 2 + x 2 + y 2 = 4 or ρ 2 = 4 or ρ = 2.

Solution
a. Use the conversion formulas to write the equations of the sphere and cone in spherical coordinates.
For the sphere:

x2 + y2 + z2 = z

ρ 2 = ρ cos φ
ρ = cos φ.

For the cone:

The curve ρ = cos φ meets the line φ = π/4 at the point ⎛⎝π/4, 2/2⎞⎠. Thus, to change the order of

Before we end this section, we present a couple of examples that can illustrate the conversion from rectangular coordinates
to cylindrical coordinates and from rectangular coordinates to spherical coordinates.

0 ≤ x ≤ 1 − y2
x 2 + y 2 ≤ z ≤ x 2 + y 2.
The first two inequalities describe the right half of a circle of radius 1. Therefore, the ranges for θ and r are

− π ≤ θ ≤ π and 0 ≤ r ≤ 1.

Solution
The ranges of the variables are

0 ≤ y≤3
0 ≤ x ≤ 9 − y2
x 2 + y 2 ≤ z ≤ 18 − x 2 − y 2.
The first two ranges of variables describe a quarter disk in the first quadrant of the xy -plane. Hence the range for

θ is 0 ≤ θ ≤ π .
2

The lower bound z = x 2 + y 2 is the upper half of a cone and the upper bound z = 18 − x 2 − y 2 is the upper
half of a sphere. Therefore, we have 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 18, which is 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 3 2.
For the ranges of φ, we need to find where the cone and the sphere intersect, so solve the equation

5.32 Use rectangular, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates to set up triple integrals for finding the volume of
the region inside the sphere x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = 4 but outside the cylinder x 2 + y 2 = 1.

Now that we are familiar with the spherical coordinate system, let’s find the volume of some known geometric figures, such
as spheres and ellipsoids.

Example 5.52
Chapter Opener: Finding the Volume of l’Hemisphèric
Find the volume of the spherical planetarium in l’Hemisphèric in Valencia, Spain, which is five stories tall and
has a radius of approximately 50 ft, using the equation x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = r 2.

Figure 5.60 (credit: modification of work by Javier Yaya Tur,
Wikimedia Commons)

Solution
We calculate the volume of the ball in the first octant, where x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, and z ≥ 0, using spherical
coordinates, and then multiply the result by 8 for symmetry. Since we consider the region D as the first octant
in the integral, the ranges of the variables are

0 ≤ φ ≤ π , 0 ≤ ρ ≤ r, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π .
2
2
Therefore,

We again use symmetry and evaluate the volume of the ellipsoid using spherical coordinates. As before, we use

0 ≤ φ ≤ π , 0 ≤ ρ ≤ π , 0 ≤ ρ ≤ 1, and 0 ≤ θ ≤ π .

Also, we need to change the rectangular to spherical coordinates in this way:

Solution
This problem is directly related to the l’Hemisphèric structure. The volume of space inside the ellipsoid and
outside the sphere might be useful to find the expense of heating or cooling that space. We can use the preceding
two examples for the volume of the sphere and ellipsoid and then substract.
First we find the volume of the ellipsoid using a = 75 ft, b = 80 ft, and c = 90 ft in the result from Example
5.53. Hence the volume of the ellipsoid is

V ellipsoid = 4 π(75)(80)(90) ≈ 2,262,000 ft 3.
3
From Example 5.52, the volume of the sphere is

V sphere ≈ 523,600 ft 3.
Therefore, the volume of the space inside the ellipsoid

Hot air balloons
Hot air ballooning is a relaxing, peaceful pastime that many people enjoy. Many balloonist gatherings take place
around the world, such as the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. The Albuquerque event is the largest hot air
balloon festival in the world, with over 500 balloons participating each year.

Figure 5.61 Balloons lift off at the 2001 Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta. (credit: David Herrera, Flickr)

As the name implies, hot air balloons use hot air to generate lift. (Hot air is less dense than cooler air, so the balloon
floats as long as the hot air stays hot.) The heat is generated by a propane burner suspended below the opening of the
basket. Once the balloon takes off, the pilot controls the altitude of the balloon, either by using the burner to heat the
air and ascend or by using a vent near the top of the balloon to release heated air and descend. The pilot has very little
control over where the balloon goes, however—balloons are at the mercy of the winds. The uncertainty over where we
will end up is one of the reasons balloonists are attracted to the sport.
In this project we use triple integrals to learn more about hot air balloons. We model the balloon in two pieces. The top
of the balloon is modeled by a half sphere of radius 28 feet. The bottom of the balloon is modeled by a frustum of
a cone (think of an ice cream cone with the pointy end cut off). The radius of the large end of the frustum is 28 feet
and the radius of the small end of the frustum is 6 feet. A graph of our balloon model and a cross-sectional diagram
showing the dimensions are shown in the following figure.

Figure 5.62 (a) Use a half sphere to model the top part of the balloon and a frustum of a cone to model
the bottom part of the balloon. (b) A cross section of the balloon showing its dimensions.

We first want to find the volume of the balloon. If we look at the top part and the bottom part of the balloon separately,
we see that they are geometric solids with known volume formulas. However, it is still worthwhile to set up and
evaluate the integrals we would need to find the volume. If we calculate the volume using integration, we can use the
known volume formulas to check our answers. This will help ensure that we have the integrals set up correctly for the
later, more complicated stages of the project.
1. Find the volume of the balloon in two ways.
a. Use triple integrals to calculate the volume. Consider each part of the balloon separately. (Consider
using spherical coordinates for the top part and cylindrical coordinates for the bottom part.)
b. Verify the answer using the formulas for the volume of a sphere, V = 4 πr 3, and for the volume of a

3

cone, V = 1 πr 2 h.

3

In reality, calculating the temperature at a point inside the balloon is a tremendously complicated endeavor.
In fact, an entire branch of physics (thermodynamics) is devoted to studying heat and temperature. For the
purposes of this project, however, we are going to make some simplifying assumptions about how temperature
varies from point to point within the balloon. Assume that just prior to liftoff, the temperature (in degrees
Fahrenheit) of the air inside the balloon varies according to the function

T 0(r, θ, z) = z − r + 210.
10
2. What is the average temperature of the air in the balloon just prior to liftoff? (Again, look at each part of the
balloon separately, and do not forget to convert the function into spherical coordinates when looking at the top
part of the balloon.)
Now the pilot activates the burner for 10 seconds. This action affects the temperature in a 12 -foot-wide
column 20 feet high, directly above the burner. A cross section of the balloon depicting this column in shown
in the following figure.

586

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

Figure 5.63 Activating the burner heats the air in a 20 -foothigh, 12 -foot-wide column directly above the burner.

Assume that after the pilot activates the burner for 10 seconds, the temperature of the air in the column
described above increases according to the formula

H(r, θ, z) = −2z − 48.
Then the temperature of the air in the column is given by

T 1(r, θ, z) = z − r + 210 + (−2z − 48),
10
while the temperature in the remainder of the balloon is still given by

T 0(r, θ, z) = z − r + 210.

3. Find the average temperature of the air in the balloon after the pilot has activated the burner for 10 seconds.

5.6 | Calculating Centers of Mass and Moments of Inertia
Learning Objectives
5.6.1 Use double integrals to locate the center of mass of a two-dimensional object.
5.6.2 Use double integrals to find the moment of inertia of a two-dimensional object.
5.6.3 Use triple integrals to locate the center of mass of a three-dimensional object.
We have already discussed a few applications of multiple integrals, such as finding areas, volumes, and the average value
of a function over a bounded region. In this section we develop computational techniques for finding the center of mass and
moments of inertia of several types of physical objects, using double integrals for a lamina (flat plate) and triple integrals
for a three-dimensional object with variable density. The density is usually considered to be a constant number when the
lamina or the object is homogeneous; that is, the object has uniform density.

Center of Mass in Two Dimensions
The center of mass is also known as the center of gravity if the object is in a uniform gravitational field. If the object has
uniform density, the center of mass is the geometric center of the object, which is called the centroid. Figure 5.64 shows a
point P as the center of mass of a lamina. The lamina is perfectly balanced about its center of mass.

Figure 5.64 A lamina is perfectly balanced on a spindle if the
lamina’s center of mass sits on the spindle.
− −

To find the coordinates of the center of mass P(x , y ) of a lamina, we need to find the moment M x of the lamina about the

x-axis and the moment M y about the y-axis. We also need to find the mass m of the lamina. Then
My
M
−
x = m and y = mx .

−

Refer to Moments and Centers of Mass (http://cnx.org/content/m53649/latest/) for the definitions and the
methods of single integration to find the center of mass of a one-dimensional object (for example, a thin rod). We are going
to use a similar idea here except that the object is a two-dimensional lamina and we use a double integral.
−

My

−

M

If we allow a constant density function, then x = m and y = mx give the centroid of the lamina.
Suppose that the lamina occupies a region R in the xy-plane, and let ρ(x, y) be its density (in units of mass per unit
area) at any point (x, y). Hence, ρ(x, y) =

lim Δm , where Δm and ΔA are the mass and area of a small rectangle

ΔA → 0 ΔA

containing the point (x, y) and the limit is taken as the dimensions of the rectangle go to 0 (see the following figure).

Figure 5.65 The density of a lamina at a point is the limit of
its mass per area in a small rectangle about the point as the area
goes to zero.

⎛
⎞
Just as before, we divide the region R into tiny rectangles R i j with area ΔA and choose ⎝x*i j , y*i j ⎠ as sample points.
⎛

⎞

Then the mass m i j of each R i j is equal to ρ⎝x*i j , y*i j ⎠ΔA (Figure 5.66). Let k and l be the number of subintervals in

x and y, respectively. Also, note that the shape might not always be rectangular but the limit works anyway, as seen in
previous sections.

Finding the Total Mass of a Lamina
Consider a triangular lamina R with vertices (0, 0), (0, 3), (3, 0) and with density ρ(x, y) = xy kg/m 2. Find
the total mass.

Solution
A sketch of the region R is always helpful, as shown in the following figure.

Consider the same region R as in the previous example, and use the density function ρ(x, y) = xy.

Find the total mass.
Now that we have established the expression for mass, we have the tools we need for calculating moments and centers of
mass. The moment M x about the x-axis for R is the limit of the sums of moments of the regions R i j about the x-axis.
Hence

Mx =

∑ ∑ ⎛⎝y*i j ⎞⎠m i j = k, lim

Finding Moments
Consider the same triangular lamina R with vertices (0, 0), (0, 3), (3, 0) and with density ρ(x, y) = xy. Find

If we choose the density ρ(x, y) instead to be uniform throughout the region (i.e., constant), such as the value 1
(any constant will do), then we can compute the centroid,

⎞

Notice that the center of mass ⎝6 , 6 ⎠ is not exactly the same as the centroid (1, 1) of the triangular region.

5 5
This is due to the variable density of R. If the density is constant, then we just use ρ(x, y) = c (constant). This

value cancels out from the formulas, so for a constant density, the center of mass coincides with the centroid of
the lamina.

5.35

Again use the same region R as above and the density function ρ(x, y) = xy. Find the center of mass.

Once again, based on the comments at the end of Example 5.57, we have expressions for the centroid of a region on the

Moments of Inertia
For a clear understanding of how to calculate moments of inertia using double integrals, we need to go back to the
general definition in Section 6.6. The moment of inertia of a particle of mass m about an axis is mr 2, where r is the
distance of the particle from the axis. We can see from Figure 5.66 that the moment of inertia of the subrectangle R i j
about the x-axis is (y*i j ) 2 ρ(x*i j , y*i j )ΔA. Similarly, the moment of inertia of the subrectangle R i j about the y-axis is

(x*i j ) 2 ρ(x*i j , y*i j )ΔA. The moment of inertia is related to the rotation of the mass; specifically, it measures the tendency
of the mass to resist a change in rotational motion about an axis.
The moment of inertia I x about the x-axis for the region R is the limit of the sum of moments of inertia of the regions

R i j about the x-axis. Hence

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

Sometimes, we need to find the moment of inertia of an object about the origin, which is known as the polar moment of
inertia. We denote this by I 0 and obtain it by adding the moments of inertia I x and I y. Hence

I 0 = I x + I y = ∬ ⎛⎝x 2 + y 2⎞⎠ρ(x, y)dA.
R

All these expressions can be written in polar coordinates by substituting x = r cos θ,

y = r sin θ, and dA = r dr dθ.

For example, I 0 = ∬ r ρ(r cos θ, r sin θ)dA.

Again use the same region R as above and the density function ρ(x, y) = xy. Find the moments of

As mentioned earlier, the moment of inertia of a particle of mass m about an axis is mr 2 where r is the distance of the
particle from the axis, also known as the radius of gyration.
Hence the radii of gyration with respect to the x-axis, the y-axis, and the origin are

Iy
I
I
R x = mx , R y = m , and R 0 = m0 ,
respectively. In each case, the radius of gyration tells us how far (perpendicular distance) from the axis of rotation the entire
mass of an object might be concentrated. The moments of an object are useful for finding information on the balance and
torque of the object about an axis, but radii of gyration are used to describe the distribution of mass around its centroidal
axis. There are many applications in engineering and physics. Sometimes it is necessary to find the radius of gyration, as in
the next example.

Center of Mass and Moments of Inertia in Three Dimensions
All the expressions of double integrals discussed so far can be modified to become triple integrals.

Definition
If we have a solid object Q with a density function ρ(x, y, z) at any point (x, y, z) in space, then its mass is

m = ∭ ρ(x, y, z)dV.

Also, if the solid object is homogeneous (with constant density), then the center of mass becomes the centroid of the
solid. Finally, the moments of inertia about the yz-plane, the xz-plane, and the xy-plane are

I x = ∭ ⎛⎝y 2 + z 2⎞⎠ρ(x, y, z)dV,

Suppose that Q is a solid region bounded by x + 2y + 3z = 6 and the coordinate planes and has density

Solution
The region Q is a tetrahedron (Figure 5.70) meeting the axes at the points (6, 0, 0), (0, 3, 0), and (0, 0, 2).
To find the limits of integration, let z = 0 in the slanted plane z = 1 ⎛⎝6 − x − 2y⎞⎠. Then for x and y find the

Solution
We have used this tetrahedron before and know the limits of integration, so we can proceed to the computations
right away. First, we need to find the moments about the xy-plane, the xz-plane, and the yz-plane:

Consider the same region Q (Figure 5.70) and use the density function ρ(x, y, z) = xy 2 z. Find the

center of mass.
We conclude this section with an example of finding moments of inertia I x, I y, and I z.

Finding the Moments of Inertia of a Solid
Suppose that Q is a solid region and is bounded by x + 2y + 3z = 6 and the coordinate planes with density

ρ(x, y, z) = x 2 yz (see Figure 5.70). Find the moments of inertia of the tetrahedron Q about the yz-plane,
the xz-plane, and the xy-plane.

Solution
Once again, we can almost immediately write the limits of integration and hence we can quickly proceed to
evaluating the moments of inertia. Using the formula stated before, the moments of inertia of the tetrahedron Q
about the xy-plane, the xz-plane, and the yz-plane are

we substitute u = g(x) = x 2 − 4. Then du = 2x dx or

Planar Transformations
A planar transformation T is a function that transforms a region G in one plane into a region R in another plane by
a change of variables. Both G and R are subsets of R 2. For example, Figure 5.71 shows a region G in the uv-plane
transformed into a region R in the xy-plane by the change of variables x = g(u, v) and y = h(u, v), or sometimes
we write x = x(u, v) and y = y(u, v). We shall typically assume that each of these functions has continuous first partial
derivatives, which means g u, g v, h u, and h v exist and are also continuous. The need for this requirement will become
clear soon.

Figure 5.71 The transformation of a region G in the uv-plane into a region R in the

xy-plane.

Definition
A transformation T: G → R, defined as T(u, v) = (x, y), is said to be a one-to-one transformation if no two
points map to the same image point.
To show that T is a one-to-one transformation, we assume T(u 1, v 1) = T(u 2, v 2) and show that as a consequence we
obtain (u 1, v 1) = (u 2, v 2). If the transformation T is one-to-one in the domain G, then the inverse T −1 exists with the
domain R such that T −1 ∘ T and T ∘ T −1 are identity functions.
Figure 5.71 shows the mapping T(u, v) = (x, y) where x and y are related to u and v by the equations x = g(u, v)
and y = h(u, v). The region G is the domain of T and the region R is the range of T, also known as the image of G
under the transformation T.

Example 5.65
Determining How the Transformation Works
Suppose a transformation T is defined as T(r, θ) = (x, y) where x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ. Find the image of
the polar rectangle G = {(r, θ)|0 < r ≤ 1, 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2} in the rθ-plane to a region R in the xy-plane. Show
that T is a one-to-one transformation in G and find T −1 (x, y).

Solution
Since r varies from 0 to 1 in the rθ-plane, we have a circular disc of radius 0 to 1 in the xy-plane. Because

θ varies from 0 to π/2 in the rθ-plane, we end up getting a quarter circle of radius 1 in the first quadrant of
the xy-plane (Figure 5.72). Hence R is a quarter circle bounded by x 2 + y 2 = 1 in the first quadrant.

612

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

Figure 5.72 A rectangle in the rθ-plane is mapped into a quarter circle in the xy-plane.

In order to show that T is a one-to-one transformation, assume T ⎛⎝r 1, θ 1⎞⎠ = T ⎛⎝r 2, θ 2⎞⎠ and show as a consequence
that ⎛⎝r 1, θ 1⎞⎠ = ⎛⎝r 2, θ 2⎞⎠. In this case, we have

T ⎛⎝r 1, θ 1⎞⎠ = T ⎛⎝r 2, θ 2⎞⎠,
⎛
⎝

(x 1, y 1) = (x 1, y 1),

r 1 cos θ 1, r 1 sin θ 1⎞⎠ = ⎛⎝r 2 cos θ 2, r 2 sin θ 2⎞⎠,
r 1 cos θ 1 = r 2 cos θ 2, r 1 sin θ 1 = r 2 sin θ 2.

Dividing, we obtain

r 1 cos θ 1
r cos θ 2
= 2
r 1 sin θ 1
r 2 sin θ 2
cos θ 1
cos θ 2
=
sin θ 1
sin θ 2
tan θ 1 = tan θ 2
θ1 = θ2

since the tangent function is one-one function in the interval 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2. Also, since 0 < r ≤ 1, we have

r 1 = r 2, θ 1 = θ 2. Therefore, ⎛⎝r 1, θ 1⎞⎠ = ⎛⎝r 2, θ 2⎞⎠ and T is a one-to-one transformation from G into R.

y

To find T −1 (x, y) solve for r, θ in terms of x, y. We already know that r 2 = x 2 + y 2 and tan θ = x . Thus

y
T −1 (x, y) = (r, θ) is defined as r = x 2 + y 2 and θ = tan −1 ⎛⎝ x ⎞⎠.

Example 5.66
Finding the Image under T
Let the transformation T be defined by T(u, v) = (x, y) where x = u 2 − v 2 and y = uv. Find the image of
the triangle in the uv-plane with vertices (0, 0), (0, 1), and (1, 1).

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

613

The triangle and its image are shown in Figure 5.73. To understand how the sides of the triangle transform, call
the side that joins (0, 0) and (0, 1) side A, the side that joins (0, 0) and (1, 1) side B, and the side that
joins (1, 1) and (0, 1) side C.

Figure 5.73 A triangular region in the uv-plane is transformed into an image in the xy-plane.

For the side A: u = 0, 0 ≤ v ≤ 1 transforms to x = −v 2, y = 0 so this is the side A′ that joins (−1, 0) and

(0, 0).
For the side B: u = v, 0 ≤ u ≤ 1 transforms to x = 0, y = u 2 so this is the side B′ that joins (0, 0) and

(0, 1).
For the side C: 0 ≤ u ≤ 1, v = 1 transforms to x = u 2 − 1, y = u (hence x = y 2 − 1) so this is the side C′
that makes the upper half of the parabolic arc joining (−1, 0) and (0, 1).
All the points in the entire region of the triangle in the uv-plane are mapped inside the parabolic region in the

xy-plane.

5.43

Let a transformation T be defined as T(u, v) = (x, y) where x = u + v, y = 3v. Find the image of the

rectangle G = {(u, v): 0 ≤ u ≤ 1, 0 ≤ v ≤ 2} from the uv-plane after the transformation into a region R in
the xy-plane. Show that T is a one-to-one transformation and find T −1 (x, y).

Jacobians
Recall that we mentioned near the beginning of this section that each of the component functions must have continuous
first partial derivatives, which means that g u, g v, h u, and h v exist and are also continuous. A transformation that has this
property is called a C 1 transformation (here C denotes continuous). Let T(u, v) = ⎛⎝g(u, v), h(u, v)⎞⎠, where x = g(u, v)
and y = h(u, v), be a one-to-one C 1 transformation. We want to see how it transforms a small rectangular region S,

Δu units by Δv units, in the uv-plane (see the following figure).

614

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

Figure 5.74 A small rectangle S in the uv-plane is transformed into a region R in the

xy-plane.

Since x = g(u, v) and y = h(u, v), we have the position vector r(u, v) = g(u, v)i + h(u, v)j of the image of the point

(u, v). Suppose that (u 0, v 0) is the coordinate of the point at the lower left corner that mapped to (x 0, y 0) = T(u 0, v 0).

The line v = v 0 maps to the image curve with vector function r(u, v 0), and the tangent vector at (x 0, y 0) to the image
curve is

∂y
r u = g u (u 0, v 0)i + h u (u 0, v 0)j = ∂ x i + j.
∂u
∂u
Similarly, the line u = u 0 maps to the image curve with vector function r(u 0, v), and the tangent vector at (x 0, y 0) to
the image curve is

∂y
r v = g v (u 0, v 0)i + h v (u 0, v 0)j = ∂ x i + j.
∂v
∂v
Now, note that

r⎛⎝u 0 + Δu, v 0⎞⎠ − r(u 0, v 0)
so r⎛⎝u 0 + Δu, v 0⎞⎠ − r(u 0, v 0) ≈ Δur u.
Δu
Δu → 0

r u = lim
Similarly,

r⎛⎝u 0, v 0 + Δv⎞⎠ − r(u 0, v 0)
so r⎛⎝u 0, v 0 + Δv⎞⎠ − r(u 0, v 0) ≈ Δvr v.
Δv
Δv → 0

r v = lim

This allows us to estimate the area ΔA of the image R by finding the area of the parallelogram formed by the sides Δvr v
and Δur u. By using the cross product of these two vectors by adding the kth component as 0, the area ΔA of the image

R (refer to The Cross Product) is approximately |Δur u × Δvr v| = |r u × r v|ΔuΔv. In determinant form, the cross

Change of Variables for Double Integrals
We have already seen that, under the change of variables T(u, v) = (x, y) where x = g(u, v) and y = h(u, v), a small
region ΔA in the xy-plane is related to the area formed by the product ΔuΔv in the uv-plane by the approximation

ΔA ≈ J(u, v)Δu, Δv.
Now let’s go back to the definition of double integral for a minute:

the subrectangles R i j in the xy-plane be the images of S i j under the transformation T(u, v) = (x, y).

Let T(u, v) = (x, y) where x = g(u, v) and y = h(u, v) be a one-to-one C 1 transformation, with a nonzero
Jacobian on the interior of the region S in the uv-plane; it maps S into the region R in the xy-plane. If f is

when we use the substitutions x = g(u, v) and y = h(u, v) and then change the limits of integration accordingly. This

y = 2x − x 2 (see the following figure).

Figure 5.76 Changing a region from rectangular to polar

Squaring and collecting terms, we find that the region is the upper half of the circle x 2 + y 2 − 2x = 0, that
is, y 2 + (x − 1) 2 = 1. In polar coordinates, the circle is r = 2 cos θ so the region of integration in polar

coordinates is bounded by 0 ≤ r ≤ cos θ and 0 ≤ θ ≤ π .

integral.

Figure 5.77 The region of integration for the given integral.

Solution
First, we need to understand the region over which we are to integrate. The sides of the parallelogram are
x − y + 1 = 0, x − y − 1 = 0, x − 3y + 5 = 0, and x − 3y + 9 = 0 (Figure 5.78). Another way to look at
them is x − y = −1, x − y = 1,

x − 3y = −5, and x − 3y = 9.

Clearly the parallelogram is bounded by the lines y = x + 1, y = x − 1, y = 1 (x + 5), and y = 1 (x + 9).

Notice that if we were to make u = x − y and v = x − 3y,

To solve for x and y,

we multiply the first equation by 3 and subtract the second equation,

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

We are ready to give a problem-solving strategy for change of variables.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Change of Variables
1. Sketch the region given by the problem in the xy-plane and then write the equations of the curves that form
the boundary.
2. Depending on the region or the integrand, choose the transformations x = g(u, v) and y = h(u, v).
3. Determine the new limits of integration in the uv-plane.
4. Find the Jacobian J(u, v).
5. In the integrand, replace the variables to obtain the new integrand.
6. Replace dy dx or dx dy, whichever occurs, by J(u, v)du dv.

In the next example, we find a substitution that makes the integrand much simpler to compute.

Example 5.71
Evaluating an Integral
Using the change of variables u = x − y and v = x + y, evaluate the integral

∬ (x − y)e

where R is the region bounded by the lines x + y = 1 and x + y = 3 and the curves x 2 − y 2 = −1 and

x 2 − y 2 = 1 (see the first region in Figure 5.79).
Solution
As before, first find the region R and picture the transformation so it becomes easier to obtain the limits of
integration after the transformations are made (Figure 5.79).

Given u = x − y and v = x + y, we have x = u + v and y = v − u and hence the transformation to use is

curves x 2 − y 2 = 1 and x 2 − y 2 = −1 become uv = 1 and uv = −1, respectively.
Thus we can describe the region S (see the second region Figure 5.79) as

Change of Variables for Triple Integrals
Changing variables in triple integrals works in exactly the same way. Cylindrical and spherical coordinate substitutions are
special cases of this method, which we demonstrate here.
Suppose that G is a region in uvw-space and is mapped to D in xyz-space (Figure 5.80) by a one-to-one C 1
transformation T(u, v, w) = (x, y, z) where x = g(u, v, w),

y = h(u, v, w), and z = k(u, v, w).

Figure 5.80 A region G in uvw-space mapped to a region D in xyz-space.

622

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

Then any function F(x, y, z) defined on D can be thought of as another function H(u, v, w) that is defined on G:

F(x, y, z) = F ⎛⎝g(u, v, w), h(u, v, w), k(u, v, w)⎞⎠ = H(u, v, w).
Now we need to define the Jacobian for three variables.

Definition

| |

The Jacobian determinant J(u, v, w) in three variables is defined as follows:

This is also the same as

The Jacobian can also be simply denoted as

∂ (x, y, z)
.
∂ (u, v, w)

With the transformations and the Jacobian for three variables, we are ready to establish the theorem that describes change
of variables for triple integrals.

Theorem 5.15: Change of Variables for Triple Integrals
Let T(u, v, w) = (x, y, z) where x = g(u, v, w), y = h(u, v, w),

and z = k(u, v, w),

be a one-to-one C 1

transformation, with a nonzero Jacobian, that maps the region G in the uvw-plane into the region D in the

xyz-plane. As in the two-dimensional case, if F is continuous on D, then

∭ F(x, y, z)dV = ∭ F ⎛⎝g(u, v, w), h(u, v, w), k(u, v, w)⎞⎠

Let us now see how changes in triple integrals for cylindrical and spherical coordinates are affected by this theorem. We
expect to obtain the same formulas as in Triple Integrals in Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates.

Solution
a. For cylindrical coordinates, the transformation is T(r, θ, z) = (x, y, z) from the Cartesian rθz-plane to
the Cartesian xyz-plane (Figure 5.81). Here x = r cos θ,
the transformation is

∭ f (x, y, z)dV = ∭ f (r cos θ, r sin θ, z)r dr dθ dz.

Figure 5.81 The transformation from rectangular coordinates to cylindrical coordinates can be treated as a change of
variables from region G in rθz-space to region D in xyz-space.

b. For spherical coordinates, the transformation is T ⎛⎝ρ, θ, φ⎞⎠ = (x, y, z) from the Cartesian pθφ-plane to
the Cartesian xyz-plane (Figure 5.82). Here x = ρ sin φ cos θ,

Since 0 ≤ φ ≤ π, we must have sin φ ≥ 0. Thus |J ⎛⎝ρ, θ, φ⎞⎠| = −ρ 2 sin φ = ρ 2 sin φ.

Figure 5.82 The transformation from rectangular coordinates to spherical coordinates can be treated as a change of
variables from region G in ρθφ-space to region D in xyz-space.

Then the triple integral becomes

in xyz-space by using the transformation

u = ⎛⎝2x − y⎞⎠/2, v = y/2, and w = z/3.
Then integrate over an appropriate region in uvw-space.

Solution
As before, some kind of sketch of the region G in xyz-space over which we have to perform the integration
can help identify the region D in uvw-space (Figure 5.83). Clearly G in xyz-space is bounded by
the planes x = y/2, x = ⎛⎝y/2⎞⎠ + 1, y = 0,
⎛
⎝

⎞
⎠

y = 4,

z = 0, and z = 4. We also know that we have to use

u = 2x − y /2, v = y/2, and w = z/3 for the transformations. We need to solve for x, y, and z. Here we find
that x = u + v,

y = 2v, and z = 3w.

Using elementary algebra, we can find the corresponding surfaces for the region G and the limits of integration
in uvw-space. It is convenient to list these equations in a table.

KEY CONCEPTS
5.1 Double Integrals over Rectangular Regions
• We can use a double Riemann sum to approximate the volume of a solid bounded above by a function of two
variables over a rectangular region. By taking the limit, this becomes a double integral representing the volume of
the solid.
• Properties of double integral are useful to simplify computation and find bounds on their values.
• We can use Fubini’s theorem to write and evaluate a double integral as an iterated integral.
• Double integrals are used to calculate the area of a region, the volume under a surface, and the average value of a
function of two variables over a rectangular region.

5.2 Double Integrals over General Regions
• A general bounded region D on the plane is a region that can be enclosed inside a rectangular region. We can use
this idea to define a double integral over a general bounded region.
• To evaluate an iterated integral of a function over a general nonrectangular region, we sketch the region and express
it as a Type I or as a Type II region or as a union of several Type I or Type II regions that overlap only on their
boundaries.

636

Chapter 5 | Multiple Integration

• We can use double integrals to find volumes, areas, and average values of a function over general regions, similarly
to calculations over rectangular regions.
• We can use Fubini’s theorem for improper integrals to evaluate some types of improper integrals.

5.3 Double Integrals in Polar Coordinates
• To apply a double integral to a situation with circular symmetry, it is often convenient to use a double integral in
polar coordinates. We can apply these double integrals over a polar rectangular region or a general polar region,
using an iterated integral similar to those used with rectangular double integrals.
• The area dA in polar coordinates becomes r dr dθ.
• Use x = r cos θ,

y = r sin θ, and dA = r dr dθ to convert an integral in rectangular coordinates to an integral

in polar coordinates.
⎛y ⎞

• Use r 2 = x 2 + y 2 and θ = tan −1 ⎝ x ⎠ to convert an integral in polar coordinates to an integral in rectangular
coordinates, if needed.
• To find the volume in polar coordinates bounded above by a surface z = f (r, θ) over a region on the xy -plane,
use a double integral in polar coordinates.

5.4 Triple Integrals
• To compute a triple integral we use Fubini’s theorem, which states that if f (x, y, z) is continuous on a rectangular
box B = ⎡⎣a, b⎤⎦ × ⎡⎣c, d⎤⎦ × ⎡⎣e, f ⎤⎦, then

f d b

∭ f (x, y, z)dV = ∫ ∫ ∫ f (x, y, z)dx dy dz
e c a

B

and is also equal to any of the other five possible orderings for the iterated triple integral.
• To compute the volume of a general solid bounded region E we use the triple integral

V(E) = ∭ 1dV.
E

• Interchanging the order of the iterated integrals does not change the answer. As a matter of fact, interchanging the
order of integration can help simplify the computation.
• To compute the average value of a function over a general three-dimensional region, we use

f ave =

1 ∭ f (x, y, z)dV.
V(E) E

5.5 Triple Integrals in Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinates

Introduction
Hurricanes are huge storms that can produce tremendous amounts of damage to life and property, especially when they
reach land. Predicting where and when they will strike and how strong the winds will be is of great importance for preparing
for protection or evacuation. Scientists rely on studies of rotational vector fields for their forecasts (see Example 6.3).
In this chapter, we learn to model new kinds of integrals over fields such as magnetic fields, gravitational fields, or velocity
fields. We also learn how to calculate the work done on a charged particle traveling through a magnetic field, the work done
on a particle with mass traveling through a gravitational field, and the volume per unit time of water flowing through a net
dropped in a river.
All these applications are based on the concept of a vector field, which we explore in this chapter. Vector fields have
many applications because they can be used to model real fields such as electromagnetic or gravitational fields. A deep
understanding of physics or engineering is impossible without an understanding of vector fields. Furthermore, vector fields

642

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

have mathematical properties that are worthy of study in their own right. In particular, vector fields can be used to develop
several higher-dimensional versions of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

6.1.3 Identify a conservative field and its associated potential function.
Vector fields are an important tool for describing many physical concepts, such as gravitation and electromagnetism, which
affect the behavior of objects over a large region of a plane or of space. They are also useful for dealing with large-scale
behavior such as atmospheric storms or deep-sea ocean currents. In this section, we examine the basic definitions and graphs
of vector fields so we can study them in more detail in the rest of this chapter.

Examples of Vector Fields
How can we model the gravitational force exerted by multiple astronomical objects? How can we model the velocity of
water particles on the surface of a river? Figure 6.2 gives visual representations of such phenomena.
Figure 6.2(a) shows a gravitational field exerted by two astronomical objects, such as a star and a planet or a planet and
a moon. At any point in the figure, the vector associated with a point gives the net gravitational force exerted by the two
objects on an object of unit mass. The vectors of largest magnitude in the figure are the vectors closest to the larger object.
The larger object has greater mass, so it exerts a gravitational force of greater magnitude than the smaller object.
Figure 6.2(b) shows the velocity of a river at points on its surface. The vector associated with a given point on the river’s
surface gives the velocity of the water at that point. Since the vectors to the left of the figure are small in magnitude, the
water is flowing slowly on that part of the surface. As the water moves from left to right, it encounters some rapids around
a rock. The speed of the water increases, and a whirlpool occurs in part of the rapids.

(b) The vector velocity field of water on the surface of a river shows the varied speeds of water.
Red indicates that the magnitude of the vector is greater, so the water flows more quickly; blue

Each figure illustrates an example of a vector field. Intuitively, a vector field is a map of vectors. In this section, we study
vector fields in ℝ 2 and ℝ 3 .

Definition
A vector field F in ℝ 2 is an assignment of a two-dimensional vector F(x, y) to each point (x, y) of a subset D
of ℝ 2 . The subset D is the domain of the vector field.
A vector field F in ℝ 3 is an assignment of a three-dimensional vector F(x, y, z) to each point (x, y, z) of a subset
D of ℝ 3 . The subset D is the domain of the vector field.

Vector Fields in ℝ 2
A vector field in ℝ 2 can be represented in either of two equivalent ways. The first way is to use a vector with components
that are two-variable functions:

644

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

F(x, y) = 〈 P(x, y), Q(x, y) 〉 .

(6.1)

The second way is to use the standard unit vectors:

F(x, y) = P(x, y)i + Q(x, y)j.

(6.2)

A vector field is said to be continuous if its component functions are continuous.

Example 6.1
Finding a Vector Associated with a Given Point
Let F(x, y) = (2y 2 + x − 4)i + cos(x)j be a vector field in ℝ 2 . Note that this is an example of a continuous
vector field since both component functions are continuous. What vector is associated with point (0, −1) ?

Solution
Substitute the point values for x and y:

F(0, 1) = (2(−1) 2 + 0 − 4)i + cos(0)j
= −2i + j.

6.1

Let G(x, y) = x 2 yi − (x + y)j be a vector field in ℝ 2 . What vector is associated with the point

(−2, 3) ?

Drawing a Vector Field
We can now represent a vector field in terms of its components of functions or unit vectors, but representing it visually by
sketching it is more complex because the domain of a vector field is in ℝ 2 , as is the range. Therefore the “graph” of a
vector field in ℝ 2 lives in four-dimensional space. Since we cannot represent four-dimensional space visually, we instead

draw vector fields in ℝ 2 in a plane itself. To do this, draw the vector associated with a given point at the point in a plane.
For example, suppose the vector associated with point (4, −1) is 〈 3, 1 〉 . Then, we would draw vector 〈 3, 1 〉 at
point (4, −1).
We should plot enough vectors to see the general shape, but not so many that the sketch becomes a jumbled mess. If we
were to plot the image vector at each point in the region, it would fill the region completely and is useless. Instead, we
can choose points at the intersections of grid lines and plot a sample of several vectors from each quadrant of a rectangular
coordinate system in ℝ 2 .
There are two types of vector fields in ℝ 2 on which this chapter focuses: radial fields and rotational fields. Radial fields
model certain gravitational fields and energy source fields, and rotational fields model the movement of a fluid in a vortex.
In a radial field, all vectors either point directly toward or directly away from the origin. Furthermore, the magnitude of
any vector depends only on its distance from the origin. In a radial field, the vector located at point (x, y) is perpendicular
to the circle centered at the origin that contains point (x, y), and all other vectors on this circle have the same magnitude.

In contrast to radial fields, in a rotational field, the vector at point (x, y) is tangent (not perpendicular) to a circle with
radius r = x 2 + y 2. In a standard rotational field, all vectors point either in a clockwise direction or in a counterclockwise
direction, and the magnitude of a vector depends only on its distance from the origin. Both of the following examples are
clockwise rotational fields, and we see from their visual representations that the vectors appear to rotate around the origin.

F(x, y) = 〈 y, −x 〉 with circles centered at the origin. (c) Vector F(a, b) is perpendicular to
radial vector 〈 a, b 〉 at point (a, b).

Analysis
Note that vector F(a, b) = 〈 b, −a 〉 points clockwise and is perpendicular to radial vector 〈 a, b 〉 . (We can
verify this assertion by computing the dot product of the two vectors: 〈 a, b 〉 · 〈 −b, a 〉 = −ab + ab = 0.)
Furthermore, vector

〈 b, −a 〉 has length r = a 2 + b 2. Thus, we have a complete description of this

rotational vector field: the vector associated with point (a, b) is the vector with length r tangent to the circle with
radius r, and it points in the clockwise direction.
Sketches such as that in Figure 6.6 are often used to analyze major storm systems, including hurricanes and
cyclones. In the northern hemisphere, storms rotate counterclockwise; in the southern hemisphere, storms rotate
clockwise. (This is an effect caused by Earth’s rotation about its axis and is called the Coriolis Effect.)

Therefore, each vector is tangent to the circle on which it is located. Also, as (a, b) → (0, 0), the magnitude of

F(a, b) goes to infinity. To see this, note that

We have examined vector fields that contain vectors of various magnitudes, but just as we have unit vectors, we can also
have a unit vector field. A vector field F is a unit vector field if the magnitude of each vector in the field is 1. In a unit
vector field, the only relevant information is the direction of each vector.

Therefore, F is a unit vector field.

6.5

Is vector field F(x, y) = 〈 −y, x 〉 a unit vector field?

Why are unit vector fields important? Suppose we are studying the flow of a fluid, and we care only about the direction in
which the fluid is flowing at a given point. In this case, the speed of the fluid (which is the magnitude of the corresponding
velocity vector) is irrelevant, because all we care about is the direction of each vector. Therefore, the unit vector field
associated with velocity is the field we would study.

If F = 〈 P, Q, R 〉 is a vector field, then the corresponding unit vector field is 〈 P ,

||F|| ||F|| ||F||

F(x, y) = 〈 y, −x 〉 is the vector field from Example 6.3, then the magnitude of F is

x 2 + y 2, and therefore the

corresponding unit vector field is the field G from the previous example.
If F is a vector field, then the process of dividing F by its magnitude to form unit vector field F/||F|| is called normalizing
the field F.

Vector Fields in ℝ 3
We have seen several examples of vector fields in ℝ 2 ; let’s now turn our attention to vector fields in ℝ 3 . These vector
fields can be used to model gravitational or electromagnetic fields, and they can also be used to model fluid flow or heat flow
in three dimensions. A two-dimensional vector field can really only model the movement of water on a two-dimensional
slice of a river (such as the river’s surface). Since a river flows through three spatial dimensions, to model the flow of the
entire depth of the river, we need a vector field in three dimensions.
The extra dimension of a three-dimensional field can make vector fields in ℝ 3 more difficult to visualize, but the idea is

652

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

the same. To visualize a vector field in ℝ 3 , plot enough vectors to show the overall shape. We can use a similar method
to visualizing a vector field in ℝ 2 by choosing points in each octant.
Just as with vector fields in ℝ 2 , we can represent vector fields in ℝ 3 with component functions. We simply need an
extra component function for the extra dimension. We write either

F(x, y, z) = 〈 P(x, y, z), Q(x, y, z), R(x, y, z) 〉

(6.3)

F(x, y, z) = P(x, y, z)i + Q(x, y, z)j + R(x, y, z)k.

or

Example 6.7
Sketching a Vector Field in Three Dimensions
Describe vector field F(x, y, z) = 〈 1, 1, z 〉 .

Solution
For this vector field, the x and y components are constant, so every point in ℝ 3 has an associated vector with x
and y components equal to one. To visualize F, we first consider what the field looks like in the xy-plane. In the
xy-plane, z = 0. Hence, each point of the form (a, b, 0) has vector 〈 1, 1, 0 〉 associated with it. For points
not in the xy-plane but slightly above it, the associated vector has a small but positive z component, and therefore
the associated vector points slightly upward. For points that are far above the xy-plane, the z component is large,
so the vector is almost vertical. Figure 6.7 shows this vector field.

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

Gradient Fields
In this section, we study a special kind of vector field called a gradient field or a conservative field. These vector fields
are extremely important in physics because they can be used to model physical systems in which energy is conserved.
Gravitational fields and electric fields associated with a static charge are examples of gradient fields.
Recall that if f is a (scalar) function of x and y, then the gradient of f is

grad f = ∇ f = f x(x, y)i + f y(x, y)j.
We can see from the form in which the gradient is written that ∇ f is a vector field in ℝ 2 . Similarly, if f is a function
of x, y, and z, then the gradient of f is

grad f = ∇ f = f x(x, y, z)i + f y(x, y, z)j + f z(x, y, z)k.
The gradient of a three-variable function is a vector field in ℝ 3 .
A gradient field is a vector field that can be written as the gradient of a function, and we have the following definition.

Definition
A vector field F in ℝ 2 or in ℝ 3 is a gradient field if there exists a scalar function f such that ∇ f = F.

Example 6.9
Sketching a Gradient Vector Field
Use technology to plot the gradient vector field of f (x, y) = x 2 y 2 f (x, y) = x 2 y 2.

Solution
The gradient of f is ∇ f = 〈 2xy 2, 2x 2 y 〉 ∇ f = 〈 2xy 2, 2x 2 y 〉 . To sketch the vector field, use a computer
algebra system such as Mathematica. Figure 6.9 shows ∇ f .

Use technology to plot the gradient vector field of f (x, y) = sin x cos y.

Consider the function f (x, y) = x 2 y 2 from Example 6.9. Figure 6.11 shows the level curves of this function overlaid
on the function’s gradient vector field. The gradient vectors are perpendicular to the level curves, and the magnitudes of the
vectors get larger as the level curves get closer together, because closely grouped level curves indicate the graph is steep,
and the magnitude of the gradient vector is the largest value of the directional derivative. Therefore, you can see the local
steepness of a graph by investigating the corresponding function’s gradient field.

Figure 6.10 The gradient field of f (x, y) = x 2 y 2 and several level curves of f .
Notice that as the level curves get closer together, the magnitude of the gradient vectors
increases.

As we learned earlier, a vector field F is a conservative vector field, or a gradient field if there exists a scalar function
f such that ∇ f = F. In this situation, f is called a potential function for F. Conservative vector fields arise in many
applications, particularly in physics. The reason such fields are called conservative is that they model forces of physical
systems in which energy is conserved. We study conservative vector fields in more detail later in this chapter.
You might notice that, in some applications, a potential function f for F is defined instead as a function such that

−∇ f = F. This is the case for certain contexts in physics, for example.

Example 6.10
Verifying a Potential Function
Is f (x, y, z) = x 2 yz − sin(xy) a potential function for vector field

F(x, y, z) = 〈 2xyz − y cos(xy), x 2 z − x cos(xy), x 2 y 〉 ?
Solution
We need to confirm whether ∇ f = F. We have

f x = 2xyz − y cos(xy), f y = x 2 z − x cos(xy), and f z = x 2 y.

656

If F is a conservative vector field, then there is at least one potential function f such that ∇ f = F. But, could there be
more than one potential function? If so, is there any relationship between two potential functions for the same vector field?
Before answering these questions, let’s recall some facts from single-variable calculus to guide our intuition. Recall that if
k(x) is an integrable function, then k has infinitely many antiderivatives. Furthermore, if F and G are both antiderivatives
of k, then F and G differ only by a constant. That is, there is some number C such that F(x) = G(x) + C.
Now let F be a conservative vector field and let f and g be potential functions for F. Since the gradient is like a derivative,
F being conservative means that F is “integrable” with “antiderivatives” f and g. Therefore, if the analogy with singlevariable calculus is valid, we expect there is some constant C such that f (x) = g(x) + C. The next theorem says that this
is indeed the case.
To state the next theorem with precision, we need to assume the domain of the vector field is connected and open. To be
connected means if P 1 and P 2 are any two points in the domain, then you can walk from P 1 to P 2 along a path that
stays entirely inside the domain.

Theorem 6.1: Uniqueness of Potential Functions
Let F be a conservative vector field on an open and connected domain and let f and g be functions such that ∇ f = F
and ∇g = F. Then, there is a constant C such that f = g + C.

Proof
Since f and g are both potential functions for F, then ∇ f = ⎛⎝ f − g⎞⎠ = ∇ f − ∇g = F − F = 0. Let h = f − g, then we
have ∇h = 0. We would like to show that h is a constant function.
Assume h is a function of x and y (the logic of this proof extends to any number of independent variables). Since ∇h = 0,
we have h x = 0 and h y = 0. The expression h x = 0 implies that h is a constant function with respect to x—that
is, h(x, y) = k 1 (y) for some function k1. Similarly, h y = 0 implies h(x, y) = k 2 (x) for some function k2. Therefore,
function h depends only on y and also depends only on x. Thus, h(x, y) = C for some constant C on the connected domain
of F. Note that we really do need connectedness at this point; if the domain of F came in two separate pieces, then k could
be a constant C1 on one piece but could be a different constant C2 on the other piece. Since f − g = h = C, we have that

f − g + C, as desired.
□
Conservative vector fields also have a special property called the cross-partial property. This property helps test whether a
given vector field is conservative.

Theorem 6.2: The Cross-Partial Property of Conservative Vector Fields
Let F be a vector field in two or three dimensions such that the component functions of F have continuous secondorder mixed-partial derivatives on the domain of F.
If

F(x, y) = 〈 P(x, y), Q(x, y) 〉

and f y = Q. By Clairaut’s theorem, f xy = f yx, But, f xy = P y and f yx = Q x, and thus P y = Q x.
□
Clairaut’s theorem gives a fast proof of the cross-partial property of conservative vector fields in ℝ 3 , just as it did for
vector fields in ℝ 2 .
The Cross-Partial Property of Conservative Vector Fields shows that most vector fields are not conservative. The
cross-partial property is difficult to satisfy in general, so most vector fields won’t have equal cross-partials.

Example 6.12
Showing a Vector Field Is Not Conservative
Show that rotational vector field F(x, y) = 〈 y, −x 〉 is not conservative.

Solution
Let P(x, y) = y and Q(x, y) = −x. If F is conservative, then the cross-partials would be equal—that is, P y
would equal Q x. Therefore, to show that F is not conservative, check that P y ≠ Q x. Since P y = 1 and

Q x = −1, the vector field is not conservative.

6.11

Show that vector field F(x, y)xyi − x 2 yj is not conservative.

Example 6.13
Showing a Vector Field Is Not Conservative
Is vector field F(x, y, z) = 〈 7, −2, x 3 〉 conservative?

Solution
Let P(x, y, z) = 7,

Q(x, y, z) = −2, and R(x, y, z) = x 3. If F is conservative, then all three cross-partial

equations will be satisfied—that is, if F is conservative, then P y would equal Q x, Q z would equal R y, and

R x would equal P z. Note that P y = Q x = R y = Q z = 0, so the first two necessary equalities hold. However,
R x = 3x 3 and P z = 0 so R x ≠ P z. Therefore, F is not conservative.

6.12

Is vector field G(x, y, z) = 〈 y, x, xyz 〉 conservative?

We conclude this section with a word of warning: The Cross-Partial Property of Conservative Vector Fields says
that if F is conservative, then F has the cross-partial property. The theorem does not say that, if F has the cross-partial
property, then F is conservative (the converse of an implication is not logically equivalent to the original implication).
In other words, The Cross-Partial Property of Conservative Vector Fields can only help determine that a field
is not conservative; it does not let you conclude that a vector field is conservative. For example, consider vector field

F(x, y) = 〈 x 2 y, x 〉 . This field has the cross-partial property, so it is natural to try to use The Cross-Partial

Property of Conservative Vector Fields to conclude this vector field is conservative. However, this is a misapplication
of the theorem. We learn later how to conclude that F is conservative.

b

We are familiar with single-variable integrals of the form ∫ f (x)dx, where the domain of integration is an interval ⎡⎣a, b⎤⎦.
a

Such an interval can be thought of as a curve in the xy-plane, since the interval defines a line segment with endpoints (a, 0)
and (b, 0) —in other words, a line segment located on the x-axis. Suppose we want to integrate over any curve in the plane,
not just over a line segment on the x-axis. Such a task requires a new kind of integral, called a line integral.
Line integrals have many applications to engineering and physics. They also allow us to make several useful generalizations
of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. And, they are closely connected to the properties of vector fields, as we shall see.

Scalar Line Integrals
A line integral gives us the ability to integrate multivariable functions and vector fields over arbitrary curves in a plane or in
space. There are two types of line integrals: scalar line integrals and vector line integrals. Scalar line integrals are integrals
of a scalar function over a curve in a plane or in space. Vector line integrals are integrals of a vector field over a curve in a
plane or in space. Let’s look at scalar line integrals first.
A scalar line integral is defined just as a single-variable integral is defined, except that for a scalar line integral, the integrand
is a function of more than one variable and the domain of integration is a curve in a plane or in space, as opposed to a curve
on the x-axis.
For a scalar line integral, we let C be a smooth curve in a plane or in space and let f be a function with a domain that
includes C. We chop the curve into small pieces. For each piece, we choose point P in that piece and evaluate f at P. (We
can do this because all the points in the curve are in the domain of f . ) We multiply f (P) by the arc length of the piece

Δs, add the product f (P)Δs over all the pieces, and then let the arc length of the pieces shrink to zero by taking a limit.
The result is the scalar line integral of the function over the curve.
For a formal description of a scalar line integral, let C be a smooth curve in space given by the parameterization
r(t) = 〈 x(t), y(t), z(t) 〉 , a ≤ t ≤ b. Let f (x, y, z) be a function with a domain that includes curve C. To define the
line integral of the function f over C, we begin as most definitions of an integral begin: we chop the curve into small
pieces. Partition the parameter interval ⎡⎣a, b⎤⎦ into n subintervals ⎡⎣t i − l, t i⎤⎦ of equal width for l ≤ i ≤ n, where t 0 = a
and t n = b (Figure 6.12). Let t*i be a value in the ith interval ⎡⎣t i − l, t i⎤⎦. Denote the endpoints of r(t 0), r(t 1),…, r(t n)

by P 0 ,…, P n. Points Pi divide curve C into n pieces C 1, C 2 ,…, C n, with lengths Δs 1, Δs 2 ,…, Δs n, respectively.
Let P*i denote the endpoint of r(t*i ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Now, we evaluate the function f at point P*i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
Note that P*i is in piece C 1, and therefore P*i is in the domain of f . Multiply f ⎛⎝P*i ⎞⎠ by the length Δs 1 of C 1,

which gives the area of the “sheet” with base C 1, and height f ⎛⎝P*i ⎞⎠. This is analogous to using rectangles to approximate
n

area in a single-variable integral. Now, we form the sum ∑ f ⎛⎝P*i ⎞⎠Δs i. Note the similarity of this sum versus a Riemann
i=1

sum; in fact, this definition is a generalization of a Riemann sum to arbitrary curves in space. Just as with Riemann sums
b

and integrals of form ∫ g(x)dx, we define an integral by letting the width of the pieces of the curve shrink to zero by
a

taking a limit. The result is the scalar line integral of f along C.

664

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

Figure 6.12 Curve C has been divided into n pieces, and a point
inside each piece has been chosen.

You may have noticed a difference between this definition of a scalar line integral and a single-variable integral. In this
definition, the arc lengths Δs 1, Δs 2 ,…, Δs n aren’t necessarily the same; in the definition of a single-variable integral, the
curve in the x-axis is partitioned into pieces of equal length. This difference does not have any effect in the limit. As we
shrink the arc lengths to zero, their values become close enough that any small difference becomes irrelevant.

Definition
Let

f

be a function with a domain that includes the smooth curve

C that is parameterized by

r(t) = 〈 x(t), y(t), z(t) 〉 , a ≤ t ≤ b. The scalar line integral of f along C is
n

(6.5)

∫ f (x, y, z)ds = n lim
∑ f ⎛⎝P*i ⎞⎠Δs i
→∞
C

i=1

if this limit exists (t*i and Δs i are defined as in the previous paragraphs). If C is a planar curve, then C can be
represented by the parametric equations x = x(t), y = y(t), and a ≤ t ≤ b. If C is smooth and f (x, y) is a function
of two variables, then the scalar line integral of f along C is defined similarly as
n

∫ f (x, y)ds = n lim
∑ f ⎛⎝P*i ⎞⎠Δs i,
→∞
C

i=1

if this limit exists.
If f is a continuous function on a smooth curve C, then ∫ f ds always exists. Since ∫ f ds is defined as a limit of
C

C

b

Riemann sums, the continuity of f is enough to guarantee the existence of the limit, just as the integral ∫ g(x)dx exists
a

if g is continuous over ⎡⎣a, b⎤⎦.
Before looking at how to compute a line integral, we need to examine the geometry captured by these integrals. Suppose
that f (x, y) ≥ 0 for all points (x, y) on a smooth planar curve C. Imagine taking curve C and projecting it “up” to the
surface defined by f (x, y), thereby creating a new curve C′ that lies in the graph of f (x, y) (Figure 6.13). Now we
drop a “sheet” from C′ down to the xy-plane. The area of this sheet is ∫ f (x, y)ds. If f (x, y) ≤ 0 for some points in
C

C, then the value of ∫ f (x, y)ds is the area above the xy-plane less the area below the xy-plane. (Note the similarity

with integrals of the form ∫ g(x)dx.)

Figure 6.13 The area of the blue sheet is ∫ f (x, y)ds.
C

From this geometry, we can see that line integral ∫ f (x, y)ds does not depend on the parameterization r(t) of C. As long
C

as the curve is traversed exactly once by the parameterization, the area of the sheet formed by the function and the curve is
the same. This same kind of geometric argument can be extended to show that the line integral of a three-variable function
over a curve in space does not depend on the parameterization of the curve.

Example 6.14
Finding the Value of a Line Integral
Find the value of integral ∫ 2ds, where C is the upper half of the unit circle.

Solution
The integrand is f (x, y) = 2. Figure 6.14 shows the graph of f (x, y) = 2, curve C, and the sheet formed by
them. Notice that this sheet has the same area as a rectangle with width π and length 2. Therefore, ∫ 2ds = 2π.

C

that is t.
Let r(t) = 〈 x(t), y(t), z(t) 〉 for a ≤ t ≤ b be a parameterization of C. Since we are assuming that C is smooth,

r′(t) = 〈 x′ (t), y′ (t), z′ (t) 〉 is continuous for all t in ⎡⎣a, b⎤⎦. In particular, x′(t), y′(t), and z′(t) exist for all t in

Although we have labeled Equation 6.6 as an equation, it is more accurately considered an approximation because we can
show that the left-hand side of Equation 6.6 approaches the right-hand side as n → ∞. In other words, letting the widths
of the pieces shrink to zero makes the right-hand sum arbitrarily close to the left-hand sum. Since

‖ r′(t) ‖ = (x′(t)) 2 + ⎛⎝y′(t)⎞⎠ 2 + (z′(t)) 2,
we obtain the following theorem, which we use to compute scalar line integrals.

Note that a consequence of this theorem is the equation ds = ‖ r′(t) ‖ dt. In other words, the change in arc length can be
viewed as a change in the t domain, scaled by the magnitude of vector r′(t).

Solution
To compute a scalar line integral, we start by converting the variable of integration from arc length s to t. Then, we
can use Equation 6.8 to compute the integral with respect to t. Note that f ⎛⎝r(t)⎞⎠ = cos 2 t + sin 2 t + t = 1 + t
and

(x′ (t)) 2 + ⎛⎝y′ (t)⎞⎠ 2 + (z′ (t)) 2 = ⎛⎝−sin(t)⎞⎠ 2 + cos 2 (t) + 1

Solution
As with the previous example, we use Equation 6.8 to compute the integral with respect to t. Note that
f ⎛⎝r(t)⎞⎠ = cos 2 (2t) + sin 2 (2t) + 2t = 2t + 1 and

the value of the line integral. Scalar line integrals are independent of parameterization, as long as the curve is
traversed exactly once by the parameterization.

Vector Line Integrals
The second type of line integrals are vector line integrals, in which we integrate along a curve through a vector field. For
example, let

F(x, y, z) = P(x, y, z)i + Q(x, y, z)j + R(x, y, z)k
be a continuous vector field in ℝ 3 that represents a force on a particle, and let C be a smooth curve in ℝ 3 contained in
the domain of F. How would we compute the work done by F in moving a particle along C?
To answer this question, first note that a particle could travel in two directions along a curve: a forward direction and a
backward direction. The work done by the vector field depends on the direction in which the particle is moving. Therefore,
we must specify a direction along curve C; such a specified direction is called an orientation of a curve. The specified
direction is the positive direction along C; the opposite direction is the negative direction along C. When C has been given
an orientation, C is called an oriented curve (Figure 6.16). The work done on the particle depends on the direction along
the curve in which the particle is moving.
A closed curve is one for which there exists a parameterization r(t),

a ≤ t ≤ b, such that r(a) = r(b), and the curve

is traversed exactly once. In other words, the parameterization is one-to-one on the domain (a, b).

closed oriented curve.

Let r(t) be a parameterization of C for a ≤ t ≤ b such that the curve is traversed exactly once by the particle and

the particle moves in the positive direction along C. Divide the parameter interval

into n pieces. Denote the length of the piece from Pi−1 to Pi by Δs i. For each i, choose a value t*i in the subinterval
⎡
⎣ i−1

, t i⎤⎦. Then, the endpoint of r(t*i ) is a point in the piece of C between P i − 1 and Pi (Figure 6.17). If Δs i is small,

then as the particle moves from P i − 1 to P i along C, it moves approximately in the direction of T⎛⎝P i⎞⎠, the unit tangent

vector at the endpoint of r(t*i ). Let P*i denote the endpoint of r(t*i ). Then, the work done by the force vector field in
moving the particle from P i − 1 to Pi is F⎛⎝P*i ⎞⎠ · ⎛⎝Δs i T⎛⎝P*i ⎞⎠⎞⎠, so the total work done along C is

Figure 6.17 Curve C is divided into n pieces, and a point
inside each piece is chosen. The dot product of any tangent
vector in the ith piece with the corresponding vector F is
approximated by F⎛⎝P*i ⎞⎠ · T⎛⎝P*i ⎞⎠.

Letting the arc length of the pieces of C get arbitrarily small by taking a limit as n → ∞ gives us the work done by the
field in moving the particle along C. Therefore, the work done by F in moving the particle in the positive direction along C
is defined as

W = ∫ f · ≤ Tds,
C

which gives us the concept of a vector line integral.

if that limit exists.
With scalar line integrals, neither the orientation nor the parameterization of the curve matters. As long as the curve is
traversed exactly once by the parameterization, the value of the line integral is unchanged. With vector line integrals, the
orientation of the curve does matter. If we think of the line integral as computing work, then this makes sense: if you hike
up a mountain, then the gravitational force of Earth does negative work on you. If you walk down the mountain by the exact
same path, then Earth’s gravitational force does positive work on you. In other words, reversing the path changes the work
value from negative to positive in this case. Note that if C is an oriented curve, then we let −C represent the same curve but
with opposite orientation.

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

As with scalar line integrals, it is easier to compute a vector line integral if we express it in terms of the parameterization

function r and the variable t. To translate the integral ∫ F · Tds in terms of t, note that unit tangent vector T along C is
C

r′(t)
(assuming ‖ r′(t) ‖ ≠ 0). Since ds = ‖ r′(t) ‖ dt, as we saw when discussing scalar line
given by T =
‖ r′(t) ‖
integrals, we have

r′(t)
‖ r′(t) ‖ dt = F⎛⎝r(t)⎞⎠ · r′(t)dt.
‖ r′(t) ‖

F · Tds = F⎛⎝r(t)⎞⎠ ·

Thus, we have the following formula for computing vector line integrals:
b

(6.9)

∫ F · Tds = ∫ a F(r(t)) · r′(t)dt.
C

Because of Equation 6.9, we often use the notation ∫ F · dr for the line integral ∫ F · Tds.
C

If r(t) = 〈 x(t), y(t), z(t) 〉 , then dr denotes vector 〈 x′ (t), y′ (t), z′ (t) 〉 .

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

Notice that this is the negative of the answer in Example 6.18. It makes sense that this answer is negative
because the orientation of the curve goes against the “flow” of the vector field.

Let C be an oriented curve and let −C denote the same curve but with the orientation reversed. Then, the previous two
examples illustrate the following fact:

∫ F · dr = −∫ F · dr.

That is, reversing the orientation of a curve changes the sign of a line integral.

We have learned how to integrate smooth oriented curves. Now, suppose that C is an oriented curve that is not smooth, but
can be written as the union of finitely many smooth curves. In this case, we say that C is a piecewise smooth curve. To
be precise, curve C is piecewise smooth if C can be written as a union of n smooth curves C 1, C 2 ,…, C n such that the
endpoint of C i is the starting point of C i + 1 (Figure 6.19). When curves C i satisfy the condition that the endpoint of

C i is the starting point of C i + 1, we write their union as C 1 + C 2 + ⋯ + C n.

Figure 6.19 The union of C 1, C 2, C 3 is a piecewise smooth
curve.

The next theorem summarizes several key properties of vector line integrals.

Notice the similarities between these items and the properties of single-variable integrals. Properties i. and ii. say that line

We want to compute each of the four integrals on the right-hand side using Equation 6.8. Before doing this, we
need a parameterization of each side of the rectangle. Here are four parameterizations (note that they traverse C
counterclockwise):

C 1 : 〈 t, 0 〉 , 0 ≤ t ≤ 2
C 2 : 〈 2, t 〉 , 0 ≤ t ≤ 1
C 3 : 〈 2 − t, 1 〉 , 0 ≤ t ≤ 2

Notice that the value of this integral is positive, which should not be surprising. As we move along curve C1 from
left to right, our movement flows in the general direction of the vector field itself. At any point along C1, the
tangent vector to the curve and the corresponding vector in the field form an angle that is less than 90°. Therefore,
the tangent vector and the force vector have a positive dot product all along C1, and the line integral will have
positive value.

Applications of Line Integrals
Scalar line integrals have many applications. They can be used to calculate the length or mass of a wire, the surface area of
a sheet of a given height, or the electric potential of a charged wire given a linear charge density. Vector line integrals are
extremely useful in physics. They can be used to calculate the work done on a particle as it moves through a force field, or
the flow rate of a fluid across a curve. Here, we calculate the mass of a wire using a scalar line integral and the work done
by a force using a vector line integral.
Suppose that a piece of wire is modeled by curve C in space. The mass per unit length (the linear density) of the wire is a
continuous function ρ(x, y, z). We can calculate the total mass of the wire using the scalar line integral ∫ ρ(x, y, z)ds.
C

The reason is that mass is density multiplied by length, and therefore the density of a small piece of the wire can be
approximated by ρ⎛⎝x * , y * , z * ⎞⎠Δs for some point ⎛⎝x * , y * , z * ⎞⎠ in the piece. Letting the length of the pieces shrink to
zero with a limit yields the line integral ∫ ρ(x, y, z)ds.

When we first defined vector line integrals, we used the concept of work to motivate the definition. Therefore, it is not
surprising that calculating the work done by a vector field representing a force is a standard use of vector line integrals.

Flux and Circulation
We close this section by discussing two key concepts related to line integrals: flux across a plane curve and circulation along
a plane curve. Flux is used in applications to calculate fluid flow across a curve, and the concept of circulation is important
for characterizing conservative gradient fields in terms of line integrals. Both these concepts are used heavily throughout
the rest of this chapter. The idea of flux is especially important for Green’s theorem, and in higher dimensions for Stokes’
theorem and the divergence theorem.

Let C be a plane curve and let F be a vector field in the plane. Imagine C is a membrane across which fluid flows, but C does
not impede the flow of the fluid. In other words, C is an idealized membrane invisible to the fluid. Suppose F represents the
velocity field of the fluid. How could we quantify the rate at which the fluid is crossing C?
Recall that the line integral of F along C is ∫ F · Tds —in other words, the line integral is the dot product of the vector
C

field with the unit tangential vector with respect to arc length. If we replace the unit tangential vector with unit normal

vector N(t) and instead compute integral ∫ F · Nds, we determine the flux across C. To be precise, the definition of
C

integral ∫ F · Nds is the same as integral ∫ F · Tds, except the T in the Riemann sum is replaced with N. Therefore,
C

where P*i

i=1

and Δs i are defined as they were for integral ∫ F · Tds. Therefore, a flux integral is an integral that is
C

perpendicular to a vector line integral, because N and T are perpendicular vectors.
If F is a velocity field of a fluid and C is a curve that represents a membrane, then the flux of F across C is the quantity of
fluid flowing across C per unit time, or the rate of flow.
More formally, let C be a plane curve parameterized by r(t) = 〈 x(t), y(t) 〉 ,

a ≤ t ≤ b. Let n(t) = 〈 y′(t), −x′(t) 〉

be the vector that is normal to C at the endpoint of r(t) and points to the right as we traverse C in the positive direction
(Figure 6.23). Then, N(t) =

n(t)
is the unit normal vector to C at the endpoint of r(t) that points to the right as we

We now give a formula for calculating the flux across a curve. This formula is analogous to the formula used to calculate a
vector line integral (see Equation 6.9).

Example 6.24
Flux across a Curve
Calculate the flux of F = 〈 2x, 2y 〉 across a unit circle oriented counterclockwise (Figure 6.24).

Figure 6.24 A unit circle in vector field F = 〈 2x, 2y 〉 .

Solution
To compute the flux, we first need a parameterization of the unit circle. We can use the standard parameterization
r(t) = 〈 cos t, sin t 〉 , 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. The normal vector to a unit circle is 〈 cos t, sin t 〉 . Therefore, the flux

Calculate the flux of F = 〈 x + y, 2y 〉 across the line segment from (0, 0) to (2, 3), where the

6.21

curve is oriented from left to right.
Let F(x, y) = 〈 P(x, y), Q(x, y) 〉 be a two-dimensional vector field. Recall that integral ∫ F · Tds is sometimes
C

written as ∫ Pdx + Qdy. Analogously, flux ∫ F · Nds is sometimes written in the notation ∫ −Qdx + Pdy, because

C

C

the unit normal vector N is perpendicular to the unit tangent T. Rotating the vector dr = 〈 dx, dy 〉 by 90° results in
vector 〈 dy, −dx 〉 . Therefore, the line integral in Example 6.21 can be written as ∫ −2ydx + 2xdy.
C

Now that we have defined flux, we can turn our attention to circulation. The line integral of vector field F along an oriented

closed curve is called the circulation of F along C. Circulation line integrals have their own notation: ∮ F · Tds. The
C

circle on the integral symbol denotes that C is “circular” in that it has no endpoints. Example 6.18 shows a calculation of
circulation.
To see where the term circulation comes from and what it measures, let v represent the velocity field of a fluid and let C be
an oriented closed curve. At a particular point P, the closer the direction of v(P) is to the direction of T(P), the larger the
value of the dot product v(P) · T(P). The maximum value of v(P) · T(P) occurs when the two vectors are pointing in the
exact same direction; the minimum value of v(P) · T(P) occurs when the two vectors are pointing in opposite directions.
Thus, the value of the circulation ∮ v · Tds measures the tendency of the fluid to move in the direction of C.
C

Example 6.25
Calculating Circulation
Let F = 〈 − y, x 〉 be the vector field from Example 6.16 and let C represent the unit circle oriented
counterclockwise. Calculate the circulation of F along C.

Solution
We use the standard parameterization of the unit circle:

r(t) = 〈 cos t, sin t 〉 , 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π. Then,

F(r(t)) = 〈 −sin t, cos t 〉 and r′(t) = 〈 −sin t, cos t 〉 . Therefore, the circulation of F along C is

Notice that the circulation is positive. The reason for this is that the orientation of C “flows” with the direction
of F. At any point along the circle, the tangent vector and the vector from F form an angle of less than 90°, and
therefore the corresponding dot product is positive.

In Example 6.25, what if we had oriented the unit circle clockwise? We denote the unit circle oriented clockwise by −C.
Then

Notice that the circulation is negative in this case. The reason for this is that the orientation of the curve flows against the

Calculating Work
Calculate the work done on a particle that traverses circle C of radius 2 centered at the origin, oriented

Learning Objectives
6.3.1 Describe simple and closed curves; define connected and simply connected regions.
6.3.2 Explain how to find a potential function for a conservative vector field.
6.3.3 Use the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals to evaluate a line integral in a vector field.
6.3.4 Explain how to test a vector field to determine whether it is conservative.
In this section, we continue the study of conservative vector fields. We examine the Fundamental Theorem for Line
Integrals, which is a useful generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to line integrals of conservative vector
fields. We also discover show how to test whether a given vector field is conservative, and determine how to build a
potential function for a vector field known to be conservative.

Curves and Regions
Before continuing our study of conservative vector fields, we need some geometric definitions. The theorems in the
subsequent sections all rely on integrating over certain kinds of curves and regions, so we develop the definitions of those
curves and regions here.
We first define two special kinds of curves: closed curves and simple curves. As we have learned, a closed curve is one that
begins and ends at the same point. A simple curve is one that does not cross itself. A curve that is both closed and simple is
a simple closed curve (Figure 6.25).

Definition
Curve C is a closed curve if there is a parameterization r(t), a ≤ t ≤ b of C such that the parameterization traverses
the curve exactly once and r(a) = r(b). Curve C is a simple curve if C does not cross itself. That is, C is simple

if there exists a parameterization r(t), a ≤ t ≤ b of C such that r is one-to-one over (a, b). It is possible for

r(a) = r(b), meaning that the simple curve is also closed.

Is the curve with parameterization r(t) = 〈 cos t,

sin(2t)
〉 , 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π a simple closed curve?

Solution
Note that r(0) = 〈 1, 0 〉 = r(2π); therefore, the curve is closed. The curve is not simple, however. To see this,
⎛ ⎞

⎛

⎞

note that r⎝π ⎠ = 〈 0, 0 〉 = r⎝3π ⎠, and therefore the curve crosses itself at the origin (Figure 6.26).

6.24

Is the curve given by parameterization r(t) = 〈 2 cos t, 3 sint 〉 , 0 ≤ t ≤ 6π, a simple closed curve?

Many of the theorems in this chapter relate an integral over a region to an integral over the boundary of the region, where
the region’s boundary is a simple closed curve or a union of simple closed curves. To develop these theorems, we need two
geometric definitions for regions: that of a connected region and that of a simply connected region. A connected region is
one in which there is a path in the region that connects any two points that lie within that region. A simply connected region
is a connected region that does not have any holes in it. These two notions, along with the notion of a simple closed curve,
allow us to state several generalizations of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus later in the chapter. These two definitions
are valid for regions in any number of dimensions, but we are only concerned with regions in two or three dimensions.

Definition
A region D is a connected region if, for any two points P 1 and P 2, there is a path from P 1 to P 2 with a trace
contained entirely inside D. A region D is a simply connected region if D is connected for any simple closed curve C
that lies inside D, and curve C can be shrunk continuously to a point while staying entirely inside D. In two dimensions,
a region is simply connected if it is connected and has no holes.
All simply connected regions are connected, but not all connected regions are simply connected (Figure 6.27).

Simply connected regions have no holes. (b) Connected regions that are
not simply connected may have holes but you can still find a path in the
region between any two points. (c) A region that is not connected has
some points that cannot be connected by a path in the region.

6.25

Is the region in the below image connected? Is the region simply connected?

Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals
Now that we understand some basic curves and regions, let’s generalize the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to line
integrals. Recall that the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that if a function f has an antiderivative F, then the
integral of f from a to b depends only on the values of F at a and at b—that is,
b

∫ a f (x)dx = F(b) − F(a).
If we think of the gradient as a derivative, then the same theorem holds for vector line integrals. We show how this works
using a motivational example.

692

Evaluating a Line Integral and the Antiderivatives of the Endpoints
Let F(x, y) = 〈 2x, 4y 〉 . Calculate ∫ F • dr, where C is the line segment from (0,0) to (2,2)(Figure 6.28).

C

⎛
⎝

Then, F r(t) = 〈 4t, 8t 〉 and r′ (t) = 〈 2, 2 〉 , which implies that

= ⎡⎣12t 2⎤⎦0 = 12.

Figure 6.28 The value of line integral ∫ F • dr depends
C

only on the value of the potential function of F at the endpoints
of the curve.

Notice that F = ∇ f , where f (x, y) = x 2 + 2y 2. If we think of the gradient as a derivative, then f is an
“antiderivative” of F. In the case of single-variable integrals, the integral of derivative g′ (x) is g(b) − g(a),
where a is the start point of the interval of integration and b is the endpoint. If vector line integrals work like
single-variable integrals, then we would expect integral F to be f ⎛⎝P 1⎞⎠ − f ⎛⎝P 0⎞⎠, where P 1 is the endpoint of the

In other words, the integral of a “derivative” can be calculated by evaluating an “antiderivative” at the endpoints
of the curve and subtracting, just as for single-variable integrals.

The following theorem says that, under certain conditions, what happened in the previous example holds for any gradient
field. The same theorem holds for vector line integrals, which we call the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals.

Theorem 6.7: The Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals
Let C be a piecewise smooth curve with parameterization r(t), a ≤ t ≤ b. Let f be a function of two or three
variables with first-order partial derivatives that exist and are continuous on C. Then,

We know that if F is a conservative vector field, there are potential functions f such that ∇ f = F. Therefore

mind, however, there is one major difference between the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus and the Fundamental Theorem
for Line Integrals. A function of one variable that is continuous must have an antiderivative. However, a vector field, even
if it is continuous, does not need to have a potential function.

This calculation is much more straightforward than the calculation we did in (a). As long as we have a
potential function, calculating a line integral using the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals is much
easier than calculating without the theorem.

Example 6.29 illustrates a nice feature of the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals: it allows us to calculate more easily
many vector line integrals. As long as we have a potential function, calculating the line integral is only a matter of evaluating
the potential function at the endpoints and subtracting.

6.26

Given

that

f (x, y) = (x − 1) 2 y + ⎛⎝y + 1⎞⎠ 2 x

is

a

function

for

F = 〈 2xy − 2y + ⎛⎝y + 1⎞⎠ 2, (x − 1) 2 + 2yx + 2x 〉 , calculate integral ∫ F · dr, where C is the lower half
C

of the unit circle oriented counterclockwise.

The Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals has two important consequences. The first consequence is that if F is
conservative and C is a closed curve, then the circulation of F along C is zero—that is, ∫ F · dr = 0. To see why this is
C

true, let f be a potential function for F. Since C is a closed curve, the terminal point r(b) of C is the same as the initial
point r(a) of C—that is, r(a) = r(b). Therefore, by the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals,

∮ F · dr = ∮ ∇ f · dr
C

C

= f ⎛⎝r(b)⎞⎠ − f (r(a))
= f ⎛⎝r(b)⎞⎠ − f ⎛⎝r(b)⎞⎠
= 0.

Recall that the reason a conservative vector field F is called “conservative” is because such vector fields model forces in

696

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

which energy is conserved. We have shown gravity to be an example of such a force. If we think of vector field F in integral

∮ F · dr as a gravitational field, then the equation ∮ F · dr = 0 follows. If a particle travels along a path that starts and
C

C

ends at the same place, then the work done by gravity on the particle is zero.
The second important consequence of the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals is that line integrals of conservative
vector fields are independent of path—meaning, they depend only on the endpoints of the given curve, and do not depend
on the path between the endpoints.

Definition
Let F be a vector field with domain D. The vector field F is independent of path (or path independent) if

∫

F · dr = ∫

C1

F · dr for any paths C 1 and C 2 in D with the same initial and terminal points.

C2

The second consequence is stated formally in the following theorem.

Theorem 6.8: Path Independence of Conservative Fields
If F is a conservative vector field, then F is independent of path.

Proof
Let D denote the domain of F and let C 1 and C 2 be two paths in D with the same initial and terminal points (Figure

6.29). Call the initial point P 1 and the terminal point P 2. Since F is conservative, there is a potential function f for F.
By the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals,

∫
Therefore, ∫

F · dr = ∫

C1

F · dr.

C2

F · dr and F is independent of path.

C2

□

Figure 6.29 The vector field is conservative, and therefore independent of path.

To visualize what independence of path means, imagine three hikers climbing from base camp to the top of a mountain.
Hiker 1 takes a steep route directly from camp to the top. Hiker 2 takes a winding route that is not steep from camp to the
top. Hiker 3 starts by taking the steep route but halfway to the top decides it is too difficult for him. Therefore he returns to
camp and takes the non-steep path to the top. All three hikers are traveling along paths in a gravitational field. Since gravity

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

697

is a force in which energy is conserved, the gravitational field is conservative. By independence of path, the total amount
of work done by gravity on each of the hikers is the same because they all started in the same place and ended in the same
place. The work done by the hikers includes other factors such as friction and muscle movement, so the total amount of
energy each one expended is not the same, but the net energy expended against gravity is the same for all three hikers.
We have shown that if F is conservative, then F is independent of path. It turns out that if the domain of F is open and
connected, then the converse is also true. That is, if F is independent of path and the domain of F is open and connected,
then F is conservative. Therefore, the set of conservative vector fields on open and connected domains is precisely the set
of vector fields independent of path.

Theorem 6.9: The Path Independence Test for Conservative Fields
If F is a continuous vector field that is independent of path and the domain D of F is open and connected, then F is
conservative.

Proof
We prove the theorem for vector fields in ℝ 2 . The proof for vector fields in ℝ 3 is similar. To show that F = 〈 P, Q 〉
is conservative, we must find a potential function f for F. To that end, let X be a fixed point in D. For any point (x, y) in
D, let C be a path from X to (x, y). Define f (x, y) by f (x, y) = ∫ F · dr. (Note that this definition of f makes sense
C

only because F is independent of path. If F was not independent of path, then it might be possible to find another path C′
from X to (x, y) such that ∫ F · dr ≠ ∫ F · dr, and in such a case f (x, y) would not be a function.) We want to show
C

C

that f has the property ∇ f = F.
Since domain D is open, it is possible to find a disk centered at (x, y) such that the disk is contained entirely inside D. Let

(a, y) with a < x be a point in that disk. Let C be a path from X to (x, y) that consists of two pieces: C 1 and C 2. The

first piece, C 1, is any path from C to (a, y) that stays inside D; C 2 is the horizontal line segment from (a, y) to (x, y)
(Figure 6.30). Then

f (x, y) = ∫

Figure 6.30 Here, C 1 is any path from C to (a, y) that

stays inside D, and C 2 is the horizontal line segment from

(a, y) to (x, y).

A similar argument using a vertical line segment rather than a horizontal line segment shows that f y = Q(x, y).
Therefore ∇ f = F and F is conservative.
□
We have spent a lot of time discussing and proving Path Independence of Conservative Fields and The Path
Independence Test for Conservative Fields, but we can summarize them simply: a vector field F on an open and
connected domain is conservative if and only if it is independent of path. This is important to know because conservative
vector fields are extremely important in applications, and these theorems give us a different way of viewing what it means
to be conservative using path independence.

Example 6.30
Showing That a Vector Field Is Not Conservative
Use path independence to show that vector field F(x, y) = 〈 x 2 y, y + 5 〉 is not conservative.

Solution
We can indicate that F is not conservative by showing that F is not path independent. We do so by giving two

different paths, C 1 and C 2, that both start at (0, 0) and end at (1, 1), and yet ∫

Conservative Vector Fields and Potential Functions
As we have learned, the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals says that if F is conservative, then calculating ∫ F · dr
C

has two steps: first, find a potential function f for F and, second, calculate f (P 1) − f (P 0), where P 1 is the endpoint of
C and P 0 is the starting point. To use this theorem for a conservative field F, we must be able to find a potential function

f for F. Therefore, we must answer the following question: Given a conservative vector field F, how do we find a function

700

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

f such that ∇ f = F ? Before giving a general method for finding a potential function, let’s motivate the method with an
example.

Example 6.31
Finding a Potential Function
Find a potential function for F(x, y) = 〈 2xy 3, 3x 2 y 2 + cos(y) 〉 , thereby showing that F is conservative.

Solution
Suppose that f (x, y) is a potential function for F. Then, ∇ f = F, and therefore

f x = 2xy 3 and f y = 3x 2 y 2 + cos y.
Integrating the equation f x = 2xy 3 with respect to x yields the equation

f (x, y) = x 2 y 3 + h(y).
Notice that since we are integrating a two-variable function with respect to x, we must add a constant of
integration that is a constant with respect to x, but may still be a function of y. The equation
f (x, y) = x 2 y 3 + h(y) can be confirmed by taking the partial derivative with respect to x:

∂f
= ∂ ⎛x 2 y 3⎞⎠ + ∂ ⎛⎝h(y)⎞⎠ = 2xy 3 + 0 = 2xy 3.
∂x
∂ x ∂ x⎝
Since f is a potential function for F,

f y = 3x 2 y 2 + cos(y),
and therefore

3x 2 y 2 + g′ (y) = 3x 2 y 2 + cos(y).
This

implies

that

h′(y) = cos y,

so

h(y) = sin y + C.

Therefore,

any

function

of

the

form

f (x, y) = x 2 y 3 + sin(y) + C is a potential function. Taking, in particular, C = 0 gives the potential function
f (x, y) = x 2 y 3 + sin(y).
To verify that f is a potential function, note that ∇ f = 〈 2xy 3, 3x 2 y 2 + cos y 〉 = F.

6.28

Find a potential function for F(x, y) = 〈 e x y 3 + y, 3e x y 2 + x 〉 .

The logic of the previous example extends to finding the potential function for any conservative vector field in ℝ 2 . Thus,
we have the following problem-solving strategy for finding potential functions:

Problem-Solving Stragegy: Finding a Potential Function for a Conservative Vector Field
F(x, y) = 〈 P(x, y), Q(x, y) 〉
1. Integrate P with respect to x. This results in a function of the form g(x, y) + h(y), where h(y) is unknown.

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11966/1.2

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

701

2. Take the partial derivative of g(x, y) + h(y) with respect to y, which results in the function g y (x, y) + h′ (y).
3. Use the equation g y (x, y) + h′ (y) = Q(x, y) to find h′ (y).
4. Integrate h′ (y) to find h(y).
5. Any function of the form f (x, y) = g(x, y) + h(y) + C, where C is a constant, is a potential function for F.

We can adapt this strategy to find potential functions for vector fields in ℝ 3 , as shown in the next example.

Example 6.32
Finding a Potential Function in ℝ3
Find a potential function for F(x, y) = 〈 2xy, x 2 + 2yz 3, 3y 2 z 2 + 2z 〉 ,

thereby showing that F is

conservative.

Solution
Suppose that f is a potential function. Then, ∇ f = F and therefore f x = 2xy. Integrating this equation with
respect to x yields the equation f (x, y, z) = x 2 y + g(y, z) for some function g. Notice that, in this case, the
constant of integration with respect to x is a function of y and z.
Since f is a potential function,

x 2 + 2yz 3 = f y = x 2 + g y.
Therefore,

g y = 2yz 3.
Integrating this function with respect to y yields

g(y, z) = y 2 z 3 + h(z)
for some function h(z) of z alone. (Notice that, because we know that g is a function of only y and z, we do not
need to write g(y, z) = y 2 z 3 + h(x, z).) Therefore,

f (x, y, z) = x 2 y + g(y, z) = x 2 y + y 2 z 3 + h(z).
To find f , we now must only find h. Since f is a potential function,

3y 2 z 2 + 2z = g z = 3y 2 z 2 + h′ (z).
This implies that h′ (z) = 2z, so h(z) = z 2 + C. Letting C = 0 gives the potential function

f (x, y, z) = x 2 y + y 2 z 3 + z 2.
To verify that f is a potential function, note that ∇ f = 〈 2xy, x 2 + 2yz 3, 3y 2 z 2 + 2z 〉 = F.

Testing a Vector Field
Until now, we have worked with vector fields that we know are conservative, but if we are not told that a vector field is
conservative, we need to be able to test whether it is conservative. Recall that, if F is conservative, then F has the crosspartial property (see The Cross-Partial Property of Conservative Vector Fields). That is, if F = 〈 P, Q, R 〉 is
conservative, then P y = Q x, P z = R x, and Q z = R y. So, if F has the cross-partial property, then is F conservative? If
the domain of F is open and simply connected, then the answer is yes.

Theorem 6.10: The Cross-Partial Test for Conservative Fields
If F = 〈 P, Q, R 〉 is a vector field on an open, simply connected region D and P y = Q x, P z = R x, and Q z = R y
throughout D, then F is conservative.

Although a proof of this theorem is beyond the scope of the text, we can discover its power with some examples. Later, we
see why it is necessary for the region to be simply connected.
Combining this theorem with the cross-partial property, we can determine whether a given vector field is conservative:

Theorem 6.11: Cross-Partial Property of Conservative Fields
Let F = 〈 P, Q, R 〉 be a vector field on an open, simply connected region D. Then P y = Q x, P z = R x, and

Q z = R y throughout D if and only if F is conservative.

The version of this theorem in ℝ 2 is also true. If F = 〈 P, Q 〉 is a vector field on an open, simply connected domain
in ℝ 2 , then F is conservative if and only if P y = Q x.

704

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

Example 6.34
Determining Whether a Vector Field Is Conservative
Determine whether vector field F(x, y, z) = 〈 xy 2 z, x 2 yz, z 2 〉 is conservative.

Solution
Note that the domain of F is all of ℝ 2 and ℝ 3 is simply connected. Therefore, we can use Cross-Partial
Property of Conservative Fields to determine whether F is conservative. Let

P(x, y, z) = xy 2 z, Q(x, y, z) = x 2 yz, and R(x, y, z) = z 2.
Since Q z = x 2 y and R y = 0, the vector field is not conservative.

Note that the domain of F is the part of ℝ 2 in which y > 0. Thus, the domain of F is part of a plane
above the x-axis, and this domain is simply connected (there are no holes in this region and this region is
connected). Therefore, we can use Cross-Partial Property of Conservative Fields to determine whether F
is conservative. Let
2

P(x, y) = x ln(y) and Q(x, y) = x .
2y
Then P y = xy = Q x and thus F is conservative.

Determine whether F(x, y) = 〈 sin x cos y, cos x sin y 〉 is conservative.

When using Cross-Partial Property of Conservative Fields, it is important to remember that a theorem is a tool, and
like any tool, it can be applied only under the right conditions. In the case of Cross-Partial Property of Conservative
Fields, the theorem can be applied only if the domain of the vector field is simply connected.
To see what can go wrong when misapplying the theorem, consider the vector field from Example 6.30:

F(x, y) =

y
i + 2−x 2 j.
x + y2

This vector field satisfies the cross-partial property, since

Since F satisfies the cross-partial property, we might be tempted to conclude that F is conservative. However, F is not
conservative. To see this, let

r(t) = 〈 cost, sint 〉 , 0 ≤ t ≤ π
be a parameterization of the upper half of a unit circle oriented counterclockwise (denote this C 1) and let

s(t) = 〈 cost, −sint 〉 , 0 ≤ t ≤ π
be a parameterization of the lower half of a unit circle oriented clockwise (denote this C 2). Notice that C 1 and C 2 have
the same starting point and endpoint. Since sin 2 t + cos 2 t = 1,

F⎛⎝r(t)⎞⎠ • r′ (t) = 〈 sin(t), −cos(t) 〉 • 〈 −sin(t), cos(t) 〉 = −1
and

F(s(t)) · s′(t) = 〈 −sint, −cost 〉 · 〈 −sint, −cost 〉
= sin 2 t + cos 2 t
= 1.

To summarize: F satisfies the cross-partial property and yet F is not conservative. What went wrong? Does this contradict
Cross-Partial Property of Conservative Fields? The issue is that the domain of F is all of ℝ 2 except for the origin.
In other words, the domain of F has a hole at the origin, and therefore the domain is not simply connected. Since the domain
is not simply connected, Cross-Partial Property of Conservative Fields does not apply to F.
We close this section by looking at an example of the usefulness of the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals. Now
that we can test whether a vector field is conservative, we can always decide whether the Fundamental Theorem for Line
Integrals can be used to calculate a vector line integral. If we are asked to calculate an integral of the form ∫ F · dr, then
C

our first question should be: Is F conservative? If the answer is yes, then we should find a potential function and use the
Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals to calculate the integral. If the answer is no, then the Fundamental Theorem for
Line Integrals can’t help us and we have to use other methods, such as using Equation 6.9.

smooth curve that goes from the origin to (1, 1, 1).

Solution
Before trying to compute the integral, we need to determine whether F is conservative and whether the domain
of F is simply connected. The domain of F is all of ℝ 3 , which is connected and has no holes. Therefore, the
domain of F is simply connected. Let

P(x, y, z) = 2xe y z + e x z, Q(x, y, z) = x 2 e y z, and R(x, y, z) = x 2 e y + e x
so that F = 〈 P, Q, R 〉 . Since the domain of F is simply connected, we can check the cross partials to
determine whether F is conservative. Note that

P y = 2xe y z = Q x

P z = 2xe y + e x = R x

Q z = x 2 e y = R y.
Therefore, F is conservative.
To evaluate ∫ F · dr using the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals, we need to find a potential function
C

f for F. Let f be a potential function for F. Then, ∇ f = F, and therefore f x = 2xe y z + e x z. Integrating
this equation with respect to x gives f (x, y, z) = x 2 e y z + e x z + h(y, z) for some function h. Differentiating
this equation with respect to y gives x 2 e y z + h y = Q = x 2 e y z,
h

is

a

function

2 y

x

of

z

only,

and

2 y

x

which implies that h y = 0. Therefore,

f (x, y, z) = x 2 e y z + e x z + h(z).

To

find

h,

note

that

f z = x e + e + h′(z) = R = x e + e . Therefore, h′(z) = 0 and we can take h(z) = 0. A potential
function for F is f (x, y, z) = x 2 e y z + e x z.
Now that we have a potential function, we can use the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals to evaluate the
integral. By the theorem,

∫ F · dr = ∫ ∇ f · dr
C

C

= f (1, 1, 1) − f (0, 0, 0)
= 2e.

Analysis
Notice that if we hadn’t recognized that F is conservative, we would have had to parameterize C and use
Equation 6.9. Since curve C is unknown, using the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals is much simpler.

Work Done on a Particle

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

707

Let F(x, y) = 〈 2xy 2, 2x 2 y 〉 be a force field. Suppose that a particle begins its motion at the origin and ends
its movement at any point in a plane that is not on the x-axis or the y-axis. Furthermore, the particle’s motion can
be modeled with a smooth parameterization. Show that F does positive work on the particle.

Solution
We show that F does positive work on the particle by showing that F is conservative and then by using the
Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals.
To show that F is conservative, suppose

f (x, y)

were a potential function for F. Then,

∇ f = F = 〈 2xy 2, 2x 2 y 〉 and therefore f x = 2xy 2 and f y = 2x 2 y. Equation f x = 2xy 2 implies that
f (x, y) = x 2 y 2 + h(y). Deriving both sides with respect to y yields f y = 2x 2 y + h′ (y). Therefore, h′(y) = 0
and we can take h(y) = 0.
If f (x, y) = x 2 y 2, then note that ∇ f = 〈 2xy 2, 2x 2 y 〉 = F, and therefore f is a potential function for F.
Let (a, b) be the point at which the particle stops is motion, and let C denote the curve that models the particle’s
motion. The work done by F on the particle is ∫ F · dr. By the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals,
C

∫ F · dr = ∫ ∇ f · dr
C

C

= f (a, b) − f (0, 0)
= a 2 b 2.

Since a ≠ 0 and b ≠ 0, by assumption, a 2 b 2 > 0. Therefore, ∫ F · dr > 0, and F does positive work on
C

the particle.

Analysis
Notice that this problem would be much more difficult without using the Fundamental Theorem for Line
Integrals. To apply the tools we have learned, we would need to give a curve parameterization and use Equation
6.9. Since the path of motion C can be as exotic as we wish (as long as it is smooth), it can be very difficult to
parameterize the motion of the particle.

6.33

Let F(x, y) = 〈 4x 3 y 4, 4x 4 y 3 〉 , and suppose that a particle moves from point (4, 4) to (1, 1)

along any smooth curve. Is the work done by F on the particle positive, negative, or zero?

6.4 | Green’s Theorem
Learning Objectives
6.4.1 Apply the circulation form of Green’s theorem.
6.4.2 Apply the flux form of Green’s theorem.
6.4.3 Calculate circulation and flux on more general regions.
In this section, we examine Green’s theorem, which is an extension of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to two
dimensions. Green’s theorem has two forms: a circulation form and a flux form, both of which require region D in the
double integral to be simply connected. However, we will extend Green’s theorem to regions that are not simply connected.
Put simply, Green’s theorem relates a line integral around a simply closed plane curve C and a double integral over the
region enclosed by C. The theorem is useful because it allows us to translate difficult line integrals into more simple double
integrals, or difficult double integrals into more simple line integrals.

Extending the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
Recall that the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that
b

∫ a F′(x)dx = F(b) − F(a).
As a geometric statement, this equation says that the integral over the region below the graph of F′(x) and above the line
segment [a, b] depends only on the value of F at the endpoints a and b of that segment. Since the numbers a and b are the
b

boundary of the line segment [a, b], the theorem says we can calculate integral ∫ F′(x)dx based on information about
a

the boundary of line segment [a, b] (Figure 6.32). The same idea is true of the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals:

∫ ∇ f · dr = f (r(b)) − f (r(a)).
C

When we have a potential function (an “antiderivative”), we can calculate the line integral based solely on information
about the boundary of curve C.

Figure 6.32 The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that
the integral over line segment [a, b] depends only on the
values of the antiderivative at the endpoints of [a, b].

Green’s theorem takes this idea and extends it to calculating double integrals. Green’s theorem says that we can calculate
a double integral over region D based solely on information about the boundary of D. Green’s theorem also says we can
calculate a line integral over a simple closed curve C based solely on information about the region that C encloses. In
particular, Green’s theorem connects a double integral over region D to a line integral around the boundary of D.

Circulation Form of Green’s Theorem
The first form of Green’s theorem that we examine is the circulation form. This form of the theorem relates the vector line

712

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

integral over a simple, closed plane curve C to a double integral over the region enclosed by C. Therefore, the circulation of
a vector field along a simple closed curve can be transformed into a double integral and vice versa.

Theorem 6.12: Green’s Theorem, Circulation Form
Let D be an open, simply connected region with a boundary curve C that is a piecewise smooth, simple closed curve
oriented counterclockwise (Figure 6.33). Let F = 〈 P, Q 〉 be a vector field with component functions that have
continuous partial derivatives on D. Then,

∮ F · dr = ∮ Pdx + Qdy = ∬ D(Q x − P y)dA.
C

(6.13)

C

Figure 6.33 The circulation form of Green’s theorem relates a
line integral over curve C to a double integral over region D.

Notice that Green’s theorem can be used only for a two-dimensional vector field F. If F is a three-dimensional field, then
Green’s theorem does not apply. Since

∫ Pdx + Qdy = ∫ F · Tds,
C

C

this version of Green’s theorem is sometimes referred to as the tangential form of Green’s theorem.
The proof of Green’s theorem is rather technical, and beyond the scope of this text. Here we examine a proof of the theorem
in the special case that D is a rectangle. For now, notice that we can quickly confirm that the theorem is true for the special
case in which F = 〈 P, Q 〉 is conservative. In this case,

∮ Pdx + Qdy = 0
C

because the circulation is zero in conservative vector fields. By Cross-Partial Property of Conservative Fields, F
satisfies the cross-partial condition, so P y = Q x. Therefore,

∬ (Q x − P y)dA = ∬ 0dA = 0 = ∮ Pdx + Qdy,

which confirms Green’s theorem in the case of conservative vector fields.

Let’s now prove that the circulation form of Green’s theorem is true when the region D is a rectangle. Let D be the rectangle

To prove Green’s theorem over a general region D, we can decompose D into many tiny rectangles and use the proof that
the theorem works over rectangles. The details are technical, however, and beyond the scope of this text.

Figure 6.35 The line integral over the boundary of the rectangle can be transformed into a
double integral over the rectangle.

Analysis
If we were to evaluate this line integral without using Green’s theorem, we would need to parameterize each
side of the rectangle, break the line integral into four separate line integrals, and use the methods from Line
Integrals to evaluate each integral. Furthermore, since the vector field here is not conservative, we cannot apply
the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals. Green’s theorem makes the calculation much simpler.

Let F(x, y) = 〈 P(x, y), Q(x, y) 〉 = 〈 y + sin x, e y − x 〉 . Then, Q x = −1 and P y = 1. Therefore,

In the preceding two examples, the double integral in Green’s theorem was easier to calculate than the line integral, so we
used the theorem to calculate the line integral. In the next example, the double integral is more difficult to calculate than the
line integral, so we use Green’s theorem to translate a double integral into a line integral.

Flux Form of Green’s Theorem
The circulation form of Green’s theorem relates a double integral over region D to line integral ∮ F · Tds, where C is the

boundary of D. The flux form of Green’s theorem relates a double integral over region D to the flux across boundary C. The
flux of a fluid across a curve can be difficult to calculate using the flux line integral. This form of Green’s theorem allows
us to translate a difficult flux integral into a double integral that is often easier to calculate.

Let D be an open, simply connected region with a boundary curve C that is a piecewise smooth, simple closed curve
that is oriented counterclockwise (Figure 6.38). Let F = 〈 P, Q 〉 be a vector field with component functions that

one integral for each side of the triangle. Using Green’s theorem to translate the flux line integral into a single
double integral is much more simple.
Let D be the region enclosed by S. Note that P x = 2x and Q y = 1; therefore, P x + Q y = 2x + 1. Green’s

v(x, y) = 〈 5x + y, x + 3y 〉 m/sec. Find the amount of water per second that flows across the rectangle with
vertices (−1, −2), (1, −2), (1, 3), and (−1, 3), oriented counterclockwise (Figure 6.41).

Figure 6.41 Water flows across the rectangle with vertices
(−1, −2), (1, −2), (1, 3), and (−1, 3), oriented counterclockwise.

Solution
Let C represent the given rectangle and let D be the rectangular region enclosed by C. To find the amount

of water flowing across C, we calculate flux ∫ v • dr. Let P(x, y) = 5x + y and Q(x, y) = x + 3y so that

v = (P, Q). Then, P x = 5 and Q y = 3. By Green’s theorem,

∫ v • dr = ∬ D⎛⎝P x + Q y⎞⎠dA

Therefore, the water flux is 80 m2/sec.

Recall that if vector field F is conservative, then F does no work around closed curves—that is, the circulation of F around
a closed curve is zero. In fact, if the domain of F is simply connected, then F is conservative if and only if the circulation of
F around any closed curve is zero. If we replace “circulation of F” with “flux of F,” then we get a definition of a source-free
vector field. The following statements are all equivalent ways of defining a source-free field F = 〈 P, Q 〉 on a simply

3. There is a stream function g(x, y) for F. A stream function for F = 〈 P, Q 〉 is a function g such that P = g y
and Q = −g x. Geometrically, F = (a, b) is tangential to the level curve of g at (a, b). Since the gradient of g is
perpendicular to the level curve of g at (a, b), stream function g has the property F(a, b) • ∇g(a, b) = 0 for any
point (a, b) in the domain of g. (Stream functions play the same role for source-free fields that potential functions
play for conservative fields.)
4.

Px + Qy = 0

Example 6.44
Finding a Stream Function
Verify that rotation vector field F(x, y) = 〈 y, −x 〉 is source free, and find a stream function for F.

Solution
Note that the domain of F is all of ℝ 2 , which is simply connected. Therefore, to show that F is source free, we
can show any of items 1 through 4 from the previous list to be true. In this example, we show that item 4 is true.
Let P(x, y) = y and Q(x, y) = −x. Then P x + 0 = Q y, and therefore P x + Q y = 0. Thus, F is source free.
To find a stream function for F, proceed in the same manner as finding a potential function for a conservative
field. Let g be a stream function for F. Then g y = y, which implies that

g(x, y) =

+ h(x).

Since −g x = Q = −x, we have h′(x) = x. Therefore,

h(x) = x + C.

To confirm that g is a stream function for F, note that g y = y = P and −g x = −x = Q.

field ∇g = 〈 x, y 〉 (Figure 6.42).

that the F vectors on a given level curve are tangent to the level curve. (b) In this image, we

the corresponding level curve. Therefore, F(a, b) • ∇g(a, b) = 0 for any point in the

6.37

Find a stream function for vector field F(x, y) = 〈 x sin y, cos y 〉 .

Vector fields that are both conservative and source free are important vector fields. One important feature of conservative
and source-free vector fields on a simply connected domain is that any potential function f of such a field satisfies
Laplace’s equation f xx + f yy = 0. Laplace’s equation is foundational in the field of partial differential equations because
it models such phenomena as gravitational and magnetic potentials in space, and the velocity potential of an ideal fluid. A
function that satisfies Laplace’s equation is called a harmonic function. Therefore any potential function of a conservative
and source-free vector field is harmonic.
To see that any potential function of a conservative and source-free vector field on a simply connected domain is harmonic,
let f be such a potential function of vector field F = 〈 P, Q 〉 . Then, f x = P and f x = Q because ∇ f = F. Therefore,

f xx = P x and f yy = Q y. Since F is source free, f xx + f yy = P x + Q y = 0, and we have that f is harmonic.

Example 6.45
Satisfying Laplace’s Equation
For vector field F(x, y) = 〈 e x sin y, e x cos y 〉 , verify that the field is both conservative and source free, find
a potential function for F, and verify that the potential function is harmonic.

Solution
Let P(x, y) = e x sin y and Q(x, y) = e x cos y. Notice that the domain of F is all of two-space, which is simply
connected. Therefore, we can check the cross-partials of F to determine whether F is conservative. Note that
P y = e x cos y = Q x, so F is conservative. Since P x = e x sin y and Q y = e x sin y, P x + Q y = 0 and the field
is source free.

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

725

To find a potential function for F, let f be a potential function. Then, ∇ f = F, so f x = e x sin y. Integrating

this equation with respect to x gives f (x, y) = e x sin y + h(y). Since f y = e x cos y, differentiating f with
respect to y gives e x cos y = e x cos y + h′(y). Therefore, we can take h(y) = 0, and f (x, y) = e x sin y is a
potential function for f .
To verify that f is a harmonic function, note that f xx = ∂ ⎛⎝e x sin y⎞⎠ = e x sin y and

∂x

f yy = ∂ ⎛⎝e x cos y⎞⎠ = −e x sin y. Therefore, f xx + f yy = 0, and f satisfies Laplace’s equation.

Green’s Theorem on General Regions
Green’s theorem, as stated, applies only to regions that are simply connected—that is, Green’s theorem as stated so far
cannot handle regions with holes. Here, we extend Green’s theorem so that it does work on regions with finitely many holes
(Figure 6.43).

Figure 6.43 Green’s theorem, as stated, does not apply to a
nonsimply connected region with three holes like this one.

Before discussing extensions of Green’s theorem, we need to go over some terminology regarding the boundary of a region.
Let D be a region and let C be a component of the boundary of D. We say that C is positively oriented if, as we walk along
C in the direction of orientation, region D is always on our left. Therefore, the counterclockwise orientation of the boundary
of a disk is a positive orientation, for example. Curve C is negatively oriented if, as we walk along C in the direction of
orientation, region D is always on our right. The clockwise orientation of the boundary of a disk is a negative orientation,
for example.
Let D be a region with finitely many holes (so that D has finitely many boundary curves), and denote the boundary of D
by ∂ D (Figure 6.44). To extend Green’s theorem so it can handle D, we divide region D into two regions, D 1 and D 2

(with respective boundaries ∂ D 1 and ∂ D 2), in such a way that D = D 1 ∪ D 2 and neither D 1 nor D 2 has any holes
(Figure 6.44).

726

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

Figure 6.44 (a) Region D with an oriented boundary has three holes. (b) Region D
split into two simply connected regions has no holes.

Assume the boundary of D is oriented as in the figure, with the inner holes given a negative orientation and the outer
boundary given a positive orientation. The boundary of each simply connected region D 1 and D 2 is positively oriented.
If F is a vector field defined on D, then Green’s theorem says that

Therefore, Green’s theorem still works on a region with holes.
To see how this works in practice, consider annulus D in Figure 6.45 and suppose that F = 〈 P, Q 〉 is a vector
field defined on this annulus. Region D has a hole, so it is not simply connected. Orient the outer circle of the annulus
counterclockwise and the inner circle clockwise (Figure 6.45) so that, when we divide the region into D 1 and D 2, we

are able to keep the region on our left as we walk along a path that traverses the boundary. Let D 1 be the upper half of

the annulus and D 2 be the lower half. Neither of these regions has holes, so we have divided D into two simply connected
regions.

We label each piece of these new boundaries as P i for some i, as in Figure 6.45. If we begin at P and travel along the
oriented boundary, the first segment is P 1, then P 2, P 3, and P 4. Now we have traversed D 1 and returned to P. Next,

we start at P again and traverse D 2. Since the first piece of the boundary is the same as P 4 in D 1, but oriented in the
opposite direction, the first piece of D 2 is −P 4. Next, we have P 5, then −P 2, and finally P 6.

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

727

Figure 6.45 Breaking the annulus into two separate regions gives us two simply connected regions.
The line integrals over the common boundaries cancel out.

Figure 6.45 shows a path that traverses the boundary of D. Notice that this path traverses the boundary of region D 1,

returns to the starting point, and then traverses the boundary of region D 2. Furthermore, as we walk along the path, the

region is always on our left. Notice that this traversal of the P i paths covers the entire boundary of region D. If we had
only traversed one portion of the boundary of D, then we cannot apply Green’s theorem to D.
The boundary of the upper half of the annulus, therefore, is P 1 ∪ P 2 ∪ P 3 ∪ P 4 and the boundary of the lower half of the

annulus is −P 4 ∪ P 5 ∪ − P 2 ∪ P 6. Then, Green’s theorem implies

crazy curve C is, the line integral of F along C can have only one of two possible values. We consider two cases:
the case when C encompasses the origin and the case when C does not encompass the origin.
Case 1: C Does Not Encompass the Origin
In this case, the region enclosed by C is simply connected because the only hole in the domain of F is at the
origin. We showed in our discussion of cross-partials that F satisfies the cross-partial condition. If we restrict the
domain of F just to C and the region it encloses, then F with this restricted domain is now defined on a simply
connected domain. Since F satisfies the cross-partial property on its restricted domain, the field F is conservative
on this simply connected region and hence the circulation ∮ F · dr is zero.
C

Case 2: C Does Encompass the Origin
In this case, the region enclosed by C is not simply connected because this region contains a hole at the origin. Let
C 1 be a circle of radius a centered at the origin so that C 1 is entirely inside the region enclosed by C (Figure

6.46). Give C 1 a clockwise orientation.

Measuring Area from a Boundary: The Planimeter

Figure 6.47 This magnetic resonance image of a patient’s
brain shows a tumor, which is highlighted in red. (credit:
modification of work by Christaras A, Wikimedia Commons)

Imagine you are a doctor who has just received a magnetic resonance image of your patient’s brain. The brain has a
tumor (Figure 6.47). How large is the tumor? To be precise, what is the area of the red region? The red cross-section
of the tumor has an irregular shape, and therefore it is unlikely that you would be able to find a set of equations or
inequalities for the region and then be able to calculate its area by conventional means. You could approximate the
area by chopping the region into tiny squares (a Riemann sum approach), but this method always gives an answer with
some error.
Instead of trying to measure the area of the region directly, we can use a device called a rolling planimeter to calculate
the area of the region exactly, simply by measuring its boundary. In this project you investigate how a planimeter
works, and you use Green’s theorem to show the device calculates area correctly.
A rolling planimeter is a device that measures the area of a planar region by tracing out the boundary of that region
(Figure 6.48). To measure the area of a region, we simply run the tracer of the planimeter around the boundary of
the region. The planimeter measures the number of turns through which the wheel rotates as we trace the boundary;
the area of the shape is proportional to this number of wheel turns. We can derive the precise proportionality equation
using Green’s theorem. As the tracer moves around the boundary of the region, the tracer arm rotates and the roller
moves back and forth (but does not rotate).

Figure 6.48 (a) A rolling planimeter. The pivot allows the tracer arm to rotate. The roller itself does not rotate; it
only moves back and forth. (b) An interior view of a rolling planimeter. Notice that the wheel cannot turn if the
planimeter is moving back and forth with the tracer arm perpendicular to the roller.

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

731

Let C denote the boundary of region D, the area to be calculated. As the tracer traverses curve C, assume the roller
moves along the y-axis (since the roller does not rotate, one can assume it moves along a straight line). Use the
coordinates (x, y) to represent points on boundary C, and coordinates (0, Y) to represent the position of the pivot.
As the planimeter traces C, the pivot moves along the y-axis while the tracer arm rotates on the pivot.
Watch a short animation (http://www.openstaxcollege.org/l/20_planimeter) of a planimeter in
action.

Begin the analysis by considering the motion of the tracer as it moves from point (x, y) counterclockwise to point

x + dx, y + dy⎞⎠ that is close to (x, y) (Figure 6.49). The pivot also moves, from point (0, Y) to nearby point

⎛
⎝

(0, Y + dY). How much does the wheel turn as a result of this motion? To answer this question, break the motion into
two parts. First, roll the pivot along the y-axis from (0, Y) to (0, Y + dY) without rotating the tracer arm. The tracer
arm then ends up at point ⎛⎝x, y + dY ⎞⎠ while maintaining a constant angle ϕ with the x-axis. Second, rotate the tracer

arm by an angle dθ without moving the roller. Now the tracer is at point ⎛⎝x + dx, y + dy⎞⎠. Let l be the distance from
the pivot to the wheel and let L be the distance from the pivot to the tracer (the length of the tracer arm).

planimeter.

theorem to calculate area D enclosed by C.
4. Show that x 2 + ⎛⎝y − Y ⎞⎠ 2 = L 2.
5. Assume the orientation of the planimeter is as shown in Figure 6.49. Explain why Y ≤ y, and use this
inequality to show there is a unique value of Y for each point (x, y): Y = y = L 2 − x 2.

You now know how a planimeter works and you have used Green’s theorem to justify that it works. To
calculate the area of a planar region D, use a planimeter to trace the boundary of the region. The area of the
region is the length of the tracer arm multiplied by the distance the wheel rolled.

6.5 | Divergence and Curl
Learning Objectives
6.5.1 Determine divergence from the formula for a given vector field.
6.5.2 Determine curl from the formula for a given vector field.
6.5.3 Use the properties of curl and divergence to determine whether a vector field is
conservative.
In this section, we examine two important operations on a vector field: divergence and curl. They are important to the field
of calculus for several reasons, including the use of curl and divergence to develop some higher-dimensional versions of the
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. In addition, curl and divergence appear in mathematical descriptions of fluid mechanics,
electromagnetism, and elasticity theory, which are important concepts in physics and engineering. We can also apply curl
and divergence to other concepts we already explored. For example, under certain conditions, a vector field is conservative
if and only if its curl is zero.
In addition to defining curl and divergence, we look at some physical interpretations of them, and show their relationship to
conservative and source-free vector fields.

Divergence
Divergence is an operation on a vector field that tells us how the field behaves toward or away from a point. Locally, the
divergence of a vector field F in ℝ 2 or ℝ 3 at a particular point P is a measure of the “outflowing-ness” of the vector
field at P. If F represents the velocity of a fluid, then the divergence of F at P measures the net rate of change with respect to
time of the amount of fluid flowing away from P (the tendency of the fluid to flow “out of” P). In particular, if the amount
of fluid flowing into P is the same as the amount flowing out, then the divergence at P is zero.

Definition
If F = 〈 P, Q, R 〉 is a vector field in ℝ 3 and P x, Q y, and R z all exist, then the divergence of F is defined by

∂Q ∂R
div F = P x +Q y + R z = ∂ P +
+
.
∂x ∂y
∂z

(6.16)

Note the divergence of a vector field is not a vector field, but a scalar function. In terms of the gradient operator

∇ = 〈 ∂ , ∂ , ∂ 〉 , divergence can be written symbolically as the dot product
∂x ∂y ∂z
div F = ∇ · F.

Note this is merely helpful notation, because the dot product of a vector of operators and a vector of functions is not
meaningfully defined given our current definition of dot product.
If F = 〈 P, Q 〉 is a vector field in ℝ 2 , and P x and Q y both exist, then the divergence of F is defined similarly as

∂Q
div F = P x + Q y = ∂ P +
= ∇ · F.
∂x ∂y
To illustrate this point, consider the two vector fields in Figure 6.50. At any particular point, the amount flowing in is
the same as the amount flowing out, so at every point the “outflowing-ness” of the field is zero. Therefore, we expect the
divergence of both fields to be zero, and this is indeed the case, as

div⎛⎝ 〈 1, 2 〉 ⎞⎠ = ∂ (1) + ∂ (2) = 0 and div⎛⎝ 〈 −y, x 〉 ⎞⎠ = ∂ (−y) + ∂ (x) = 0.

By contrast, consider radial vector field R(x, y) = 〈 −x, −y 〉 in Figure 6.51. At any given point, more fluid is flowing
in than is flowing out, and therefore the “outgoingness” of the field is negative. We expect the divergence of this field to be
negative, and this is indeed the case, as div(R) = ∂ (−x) + ∂ (−y) = −2.

Figure 6.51 This vector field has negative divergence.

To get a global sense of what divergence is telling us, suppose that a vector field in ℝ 2 represents the velocity of a fluid.
Imagine taking an elastic circle (a circle with a shape that can be changed by the vector field) and dropping it into a fluid.
If the circle maintains its exact area as it flows through the fluid, then the divergence is zero. This would occur for both
vector fields in Figure 6.50. On the other hand, if the circle’s shape is distorted so that its area shrinks or expands, then the
divergence is not zero. Imagine dropping such an elastic circle into the radial vector field in Figure 6.51 so that the center
of the circle lands at point (3, 3). The circle would flow toward the origin, and as it did so the front of the circle would travel
more slowly than the back, causing the circle to “scrunch” and lose area. This is how you can see a negative divergence.

Example 6.48
Calculating Divergence at a Point
If F(x, y, z) = e x i + yzj − y 2 k, then find the divergence of F at (0, 2, −1).

Solution
The divergence of F is

∂ (e x) + ∂ (yz) − ∂ ⎛yz 2⎞ = e x + z − 2yz.
∂x
∂y
∂ z⎝ ⎠
Therefore, the divergence at (0, 2, −1) is e 0 − 1 + 4 = 4. If F represents the velocity of a fluid, then more
fluid is flowing out than flowing in at point (0, 2, −1).

One application for divergence occurs in physics, when working with magnetic fields. A magnetic field is a vector field that
models the influence of electric currents and magnetic materials. Physicists use divergence in Gauss’s law for magnetism,

740

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

which states that if B is a magnetic field, then ∇ · B = 0; in other words, the divergence of a magnetic field is zero.

Example 6.49
Determining Whether a Field Is Magnetic
Is it possible for F(x, y) = 〈 x 2 y, y − xy 2 〉 to be a magnetic field?

Solution
If F were magnetic, then its divergence would be zero. The divergence of F is

∂ ⎛x 2 y⎞ + ∂ ⎛y − xy 2⎞ = 2xy + 1 − 2xy = 1
⎠
⎠
∂ y⎝
∂ x⎝
and therefore F cannot model a magnetic field (Figure 6.52).

Figure 6.52 The divergence of vector field F(x, y) = 〈 x 2 y, y − xy 2 〉 is one, so it
cannot model a magnetic field.

Another application for divergence is detecting whether a field is source free. Recall that a source-free field is a vector
field that has a stream function; equivalently, a source-free field is a field with a flux that is zero along any closed curve.
The next two theorems say that, under certain conditions, source-free vector fields are precisely the vector fields with zero
divergence.

Theorem 6.14: Divergence of a Source-Free Vector Field
If F = 〈 P, Q 〉 is a source-free continuous vector field with differentiable component functions, then div F = 0.

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

741

Proof
Since F is source free, there is a function g(x, y) with g y = P and −g x = Q. Therefore, F = 〈 g y, −g x 〉 and

div F = g yx − g xy = 0 by Clairaut’s theorem.
□
The converse of Divergence of a Source-Free Vector Field is true on simply connected regions, but the proof is too
technical to include here. Thus, we have the following theorem, which can test whether a vector field in ℝ 2 is source
free.

Theorem 6.15: Divergence Test for Source-Free Vector Fields
Let F = 〈 P, Q 〉 be a continuous vector field with differentiable component functions with a domain that is simply
connected. Then, div F = 0 if and only if F is source free.

Example 6.50
Determining Whether a Field Is Source Free
Is field F(x, y) = 〈 x 2 y, 5 − xy 2 〉 source free?

Solution
Note the domain of F is ℝ 2 , which is simply connected. Furthermore, F is continuous with differentiable
component functions. Therefore, we can use Divergence Test for Source-Free Vector Fields to analyze F.
The divergence of F is

∂ ⎛x 2 y⎞ + ∂ ⎛5 − xy 2⎞ = 2xy − 2xy = 0.
⎠
⎠
∂ y⎝
∂ x⎝
Therefore, F is source free by Divergence Test for Source-Free Vector Fields.

6.41

Let F(x, y) = 〈 −ay, bx 〉 be a rotational field where a and b are positive constants. Is F source free?

Recall that the flux form of Green’s theorem says that

∮ F · Nds = ∬ DP x + Q y dA,
C

where C is a simple closed curve and D is the region enclosed by C. Since P x + Q y = div F, Green’s theorem is
sometimes written as

∮ F · Nds = ∬ Ddiv FdA.
C

Therefore, Green’s theorem can be written in terms of divergence. If we think of divergence as a derivative of sorts, then
Green’s theorem says the “derivative” of F on a region can be translated into a line integral of F along the boundary of
the region. This is analogous to the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, in which the derivative of a function f on a line
segment [a, b] can be translated into a statement about f on the boundary of [a, b]. Using divergence, we can see that
Green’s theorem is a higher-dimensional analog of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.

742

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

We can use all of what we have learned in the application of divergence. Let v be a vector field modeling the velocity of a
fluid. Since the divergence of v at point P measures the “outflowing-ness” of the fluid at P, div v(P) > 0 implies that more
fluid is flowing out of P than flowing in. Similarly, div v(P) < 0 implies the more fluid is flowing in to P than is flowing
out, and div v(P) = 0 implies the same amount of fluid is flowing in as flowing out.

Example 6.51
Determining Flow of a Fluid
Suppose v(x, y) = 〈 −xy, y 〉 , y > 0 models the flow of a fluid. Is more fluid flowing into point (1, 4) than
flowing out?

Solution
To determine whether more fluid is flowing into (1, 4) than is flowing out, we calculate the divergence of v at

(1, 4):
div(v) = ∂ (−xy) + ∂ (y) = −y + 1.
∂x
∂y
To find the divergence at (1, 4), substitute the point into the divergence: −4 + 1 = −3. Since the divergence
of v at (1, 4) is negative, more fluid is flowing in than flowing out (Figure 6.53).

Figure 6.53 Vector field v(x, y) = 〈 −xy, y 〉 has negative divergence at (1, 4).

6.42

For vector field v(x, y) = 〈 −xy, y 〉 , y > 0, find all points P such that the amount of fluid flowing

in to P equals the amount of fluid flowing out of P.

Curl
The second operation on a vector field that we examine is the curl, which measures the extent of rotation of the field about
a point. Suppose that F represents the velocity field of a fluid. Then, the curl of F at point P is a vector that measures the

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

743

tendency of particles near P to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of this vector. The magnitude of the curl
vector at P measures how quickly the particles rotate around this axis. In other words, the curl at a point is a measure of the
vector field’s “spin” at that point. Visually, imagine placing a paddlewheel into a fluid at P, with the axis of the paddlewheel
aligned with the curl vector (Figure 6.54). The curl measures the tendency of the paddlewheel to rotate.

Figure 6.54 To visualize curl at a point, imagine placing a
small paddlewheel into the vector field at a point.

Consider the vector fields in Figure 6.50. In part (a), the vector field is constant and there is no spin at any point. Therefore,
we expect the curl of the field to be zero, and this is indeed the case. Part (b) shows a rotational field, so the field has spin.
In particular, if you place a paddlewheel into a field at any point so that the axis of the wheel is perpendicular to a plane,
the wheel rotates counterclockwise. Therefore, we expect the curl of the field to be nonzero, and this is indeed the case (the
curl is 2k).
To see what curl is measuring globally, imagine dropping a leaf into the fluid. As the leaf moves along with the fluid flow,
the curl measures the tendency of the leaf to rotate. If the curl is zero, then the leaf doesn’t rotate as it moves through the
fluid.

Definition
If F = 〈 P, Q, R 〉 is a vector field in ℝ 3 , and P x, Q y, and R z all exist, then the curl of F is defined by

curl F = ⎛⎝R y − Q z⎞⎠i + ⎛⎝P z − R x⎞⎠j + ⎛⎝Q x − P y⎞⎠k

Note that the curl of a vector field is a vector field, in contrast to divergence.
The definition of curl can be difficult to remember. To help with remembering, we use the notation ∇ × F to stand for a
“determinant” that gives the curl formula:

Solution
Notice that this vector field consists of vectors that are all parallel. In fact, each vector in the field is parallel to
the x-axis. This fact might lead us to the conclusion that the field has no spin and that the curl is zero. To test this
theory, note that

curl F = ⎛⎝Q x − P y⎞⎠k = −k ≠ 0.
Therefore, this vector field does have spin. To see why, imagine placing a paddlewheel at any point in the first
quadrant (Figure 6.55). The larger magnitudes of the vectors at the top of the wheel cause the wheel to rotate.
The wheel rotates in the clockwise (negative) direction, causing the coefficient of the curl to be negative.

Note that if F = 〈 P, Q 〉 is a vector field in a plane, then curl F · k = ⎛⎝Q x − P y⎞⎠k · k = Q x − P y. Therefore, the
circulation form of Green’s theorem is sometimes written as

∮ F · dr = ∬ Dcurl F · kdA,
C

where C is a simple closed curve and D is the region enclosed by C. Therefore, the circulation form of Green’s theorem can
be written in terms of the curl. If we think of curl as a derivative of sorts, then Green’s theorem says that the “derivative” of F
on a region can be translated into a line integral of F along the boundary of the region. This is analogous to the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus, in which the derivative of a function f on line segment [a, b] can be translated into a statement
about f on the boundary of [a, b]. Using curl, we can see the circulation form of Green’s theorem is a higher-dimensional
analog of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
We can now use what we have learned about curl to show that gravitational fields have no “spin.” Suppose there is an object

this fluid, as the leaf moves over time, the leaf does not rotate.

Using Divergence and Curl
Now that we understand the basic concepts of divergence and curl, we can discuss their properties and establish
relationships between them and conservative vector fields.
If F is a vector field in ℝ 3 , then the curl of F is also a vector field in ℝ 3 . Therefore, we can take the divergence of
a curl. The next theorem says that the result is always zero. This result is useful because it gives us a way to show that
some vector fields are not the curl of any other field. To give this result a physical interpretation, recall that divergence of a
velocity field v at point P measures the tendency of the corresponding fluid to flow out of P. Since div curl (v) = 0, the
net rate of flow in vector field curl(v) at any point is zero. Taking the curl of vector field F eliminates whatever divergence
was present in F.

Theorem 6.16: Divergence of the Curl
Let F = 〈 P, Q, R 〉 be a vector field in ℝ 3 such that the component functions all have continuous second-order
partial derivatives. Then, div curl (F) = ∇ · (∇ × F) = 0.

Proof
By the definitions of divergence and curl, and by Clairaut’s theorem,

= 0.
□

Example 6.55
Showing That a Vector Field Is Not the Curl of Another
Show that F(x, y, z) = e x i + yzj + xz 2 k is not the curl of another vector field. That is, show that there is no
other vector G with curl G = F.

Solution
Notice that the domain of F is all of ℝ 3 and the second-order partials of F are all continuous. Therefore, we
can apply the previous theorem to F.
The divergence of F is e x + z + 2xz. If F were the curl of vector field G, then div F = div curl G = 0. But, the
divergence of F is not zero, and therefore F is not the curl of any other vector field.

6.45

Is it possible for G(x, y, z) = 〈 sin x, cos y, sin(xyz) 〉 to be the curl of a vector field?

With the next two theorems, we show that if F is a conservative vector field then its curl is zero, and if the domain of F is
simply connected then the converse is also true. This gives us another way to test whether a vector field is conservative.

Theorem 6.17: Curl of a Conservative Vector Field
If F = 〈 P, Q, R 〉 is conservative, then curl F = 0.

Proof
Since conservative vector fields satisfy the cross-partials property, all the cross-partials of F are equal. Therefore,

curl F = ⎛⎝R y − Q z⎞⎠i + ⎛⎝P z − R x⎞⎠j + ⎛⎝Q x − P y⎞⎠k
= 0.
□
The same theorem is true for vector fields in a plane.
Since a conservative vector field is the gradient of a scalar function, the previous theorem says that curl ⎛⎝∇ f ⎞⎠ = 0 for any
scalar function f . In terms of our curl notation, ∇ × ∇ ⎛⎝ f ⎞⎠ = 0. This equation makes sense because the cross product of a

vector with itself is always the zero vector. Sometimes equation ∇ × ∇ ⎛⎝ f ⎞⎠ = 0 is simplified as ∇ × ∇ = 0.

Theorem 6.18: Curl Test for a Conservative Field
Let F = 〈 P, Q, R 〉 be a vector field in space on a simply connected domain. If curl F = 0, then F is conservative.

748

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

Proof
Since curl F = 0, we have that R y = Q z, P z = R x, and Q x = P y. Therefore, F satisfies the cross-partials property on
a simply connected domain, and Cross-Partial Property of Conservative Fields implies that F is conservative.
□
The same theorem is also true in a plane. Therefore, if F is a vector field in a plane or in space and the domain is simply
connected, then F is conservative if and only if curl F = 0.

Example 6.56
Testing Whether a Vector Field Is Conservative
Use the curl to determine whether F(x, y, z) = 〈 yz, xz, xy 〉 is conservative.

Solution
Note that the domain of F is all of ℝ 3 , which is simply connected (Figure 6.56). Therefore, we can test
whether F is conservative by calculating its curl.

Figure 6.56 The curl of vector field
F(x, y, z) = 〈 yz, xz, xy 〉 is zero.

The curl of F is

⎛∂
∂ ⎞ ⎛∂
∂ ⎞ ⎛∂
∂ ⎞
⎝∂ y xy − ∂ z xz⎠i + ⎝∂ y yz − ∂ z xy⎠j + ⎝∂ y xz − ∂ z yz⎠k = (x − x)i + (y − y)j + (z − z)k = 0.

Thus, F is conservative.

We have seen that the curl of a gradient is zero. What is the divergence of a gradient? If f is a function of two variables,
then div(∇ f ) = ∇ · (∇ f ) = f xx + f yy. We abbreviate this “double dot product” as ∇ 2 . This operator is called the
Laplace operator, and in this notation Laplace’s equation becomes ∇ 2 f = 0. Therefore, a harmonic function is a function
that becomes zero after taking the divergence of a gradient.
Similarly, if f is a function of three variables then

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11966/1.2

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

749

div(∇ f ) = ∇ · (∇ f ) = f xx + f yy + f zz.
Using this notation we get Laplace’s equation for harmonic functions of three variables:

∇ 2 f = 0.
Harmonic functions arise in many applications. For example, the potential function of an electrostatic field in a region of
space that has no static charge is harmonic.

Example 6.57
Analyzing a Function
Is it possible for f (x, y) = x 2 + x − y to be the potential function of an electrostatic field that is located in a
region of ℝ 2 free of static charge?

Solution
If f were such a potential function, then f would be harmonic. Note that f xx = 2 and f yy = 0, and so

f xx + f yy ≠ 0. Therefore, f is not harmonic and f cannot represent an electrostatic potential.

6.6 | Surface Integrals
Learning Objectives
6.6.1 Find the parametric representations of a cylinder, a cone, and a sphere.
6.6.2 Describe the surface integral of a scalar-valued function over a parametric surface.
6.6.3 Use a surface integral to calculate the area of a given surface.
6.6.4 Explain the meaning of an oriented surface, giving an example.
6.6.5 Describe the surface integral of a vector field.
6.6.6 Use surface integrals to solve applied problems.
We have seen that a line integral is an integral over a path in a plane or in space. However, if we wish to integrate over
a surface (a two-dimensional object) rather than a path (a one-dimensional object) in space, then we need a new kind of
integral that can handle integration over objects in higher dimensions. We can extend the concept of a line integral to a
surface integral to allow us to perform this integration.
Surface integrals are important for the same reasons that line integrals are important. They have many applications to
physics and engineering, and they allow us to develop higher dimensional versions of the Fundamental Theorem of
Calculus. In particular, surface integrals allow us to generalize Green’s theorem to higher dimensions, and they appear in
some important theorems we discuss in later sections.

Parametric Surfaces
A surface integral is similar to a line integral, except the integration is done over a surface rather than a path. In this sense,
surface integrals expand on our study of line integrals. Just as with line integrals, there are two kinds of surface integrals: a
surface integral of a scalar-valued function and a surface integral of a vector field.
However, before we can integrate over a surface, we need to consider the surface itself. Recall that to calculate a scalar
or vector line integral over curve C, we first need to parameterize C. In a similar way, to calculate a surface integral over
surface S, we need to parameterize S. That is, we need a working concept of a parameterized surface (or a parametric
surface), in the same way that we already have a concept of a parameterized curve.
A parameterized surface is given by a description of the form

r(u, v) = 〈 x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v) 〉 .
Notice that this parameterization involves two parameters, u and v, because a surface is two-dimensional, and therefore two
variables are needed to trace out the surface. The parameters u and v vary over a region called the parameter domain, or
parameter space—the set of points in the uv-plane that can be substituted into r. Each choice of u and v in the parameter
domain gives a point on the surface, just as each choice of a parameter t gives a point on a parameterized curve. The entire
surface is created by making all possible choices of u and v over the parameter domain.

Definition
Given a parameterization of surface r(u, v) = 〈 x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v) 〉 ,

the parameter domain of the

parameterization is the set of points in the uv-plane that can be substituted into r.

Example 6.58
Parameterizing a Cylinder
Describe surface S parameterized by

r(u, v) = 〈 cos u, sin u, v 〉 , −∞ < u < ∞, −∞ < v < ∞.

754

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

Solution
To get an idea of the shape of the surface, we first plot some points. Since the parameter domain is all
of ℝ 2 , we can choose any value for u and v and plot the corresponding point. If u = v = 0, then

r(0, 0) = 〈 1, 0, 0 〉 ,

so point (1, 0, 0) is on S. Similarly, points

⎛
⎞
r⎝π , 4⎠ = (0, 1, 4) are on S.
2

r(π, 2) = (−1, 0, 2)

and

Although plotting points may give us an idea of the shape of the surface, we usually need quite a few points to see
the shape. Since it is time-consuming to plot dozens or hundreds of points, we use another strategy. To visualize
S, we visualize two families of curves that lie on S. In the first family of curves we hold u constant; in the second
family of curves we hold v constant. This allows us to build a “skeleton” of the surface, thereby getting an idea of
its shape.
First, suppose that u is a constant K. Then the curve traced out by the parameterization is 〈 cos K, sin K, v 〉 ,
which gives a vertical line that goes through point (cos K, sin K, v) in the xy-plane.
Now suppose that v is a constant K. Then the curve traced out by the parameterization is 〈 cos u, sin u, K 〉 ,
which gives a circle in plane z = K with radius 1 and center (0, 0, K).
If u is held constant, then we get vertical lines; if v is held constant, then we get circles of radius 1 centered around
the vertical line that goes through the origin. Therefore the surface traced out by the parameterization is cylinder
x 2 + y 2 = 1 (Figure 6.57).

Notice that if x = cos u and y = sin u, then x 2 + y 2 = 1, so points from S do indeed lie on the cylinder.
Conversely, each point on the cylinder is contained in some circle 〈 cos u, sin u, k 〉 for some k, and therefore
each point on the cylinder is contained in the parameterized surface (Figure 6.58).

parameterization

It follows from Example 6.58 that we can parameterize all cylinders of the form x 2 + y 2 = R 2. If S is a cylinder given
by equation x 2 + y 2 = R 2, then a parameterization of S is

r(u, v) = 〈 R cos u, R sin u, v 〉 , 0 ≤ u < 2π, −∞ < v < ∞.
We can also find different types of surfaces given their parameterization, or we can find a parameterization when we are
given a surface.

Solution

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

Notice that if u is held constant, then the resulting curve is a circle of radius u in plane z = u. Therefore, as u
increases, the radius of the resulting circle increases. If v is held constant, then the resulting curve is a vertical
parabola. Therefore, we expect the surface to be an elliptic paraboloid. To confirm this, notice that

x 2 + y 2 = (u cos v) 2 + (u sin v) 2
= u 2 cos 2 v + u 2 sin 2 v
= u2
= z.

Therefore, the surface is elliptic paraboloid x 2 + y 2 = z (Figure 6.59).

arise from holding v constant. (b) An elliptic paraboloid results from all choices of

Finding a Parameterization
Give a parameterization of the cone x 2 + y 2 = z 2 lying on or above the plane z = −2.

Solution
The horizontal cross-section of the cone at height z = u is circle x 2 + y 2 = u 2. Therefore, a point on the
cone at height u has coordinates (u cos v, u sin v, u) for angle v. Hence, a parameterization of the cone is

r(u, v) = 〈 u cos v, u sin v, u 〉 . Since we are not interested in the entire cone, only the portion on or above

6.49

Give a parameterization for the portion of cone x 2 + y 2 = z 2 lying in the first octant.

We have discussed parameterizations of various surfaces, but two important types of surfaces need a separate discussion:
spheres and graphs of two-variable functions. To parameterize a sphere, it is easiest to use spherical coordinates. The sphere
of radius ρ centered at the origin is given by the parameterization

r⎛⎝ϕ, θ⎞⎠ = 〈 ρ cos θ sin ϕ, ρ sin θ sin ϕ, ρ cos ϕ 〉 , 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π, 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ π.
The idea of this parameterization is that as ϕ sweeps downward from the positive z-axis, a circle of radius ρ sin ϕ is traced
out by letting θ run from 0 to 2π. To see this, let ϕ be fixed. Then

x 2 + y 2 = ⎛⎝ρ cos θ sin ϕ⎞⎠ 2 + ⎛⎝ρ sin θ sin ϕ⎞⎠ 2
= ρ 2 sin 2 ϕ⎛⎝cos 2 θ + sin 2 θ⎞⎠
= ρ 2 sin 2 ϕ

= ⎛⎝ρ sin ϕ⎞⎠ 2.

This results in the desired circle (Figure 6.61).

758

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

Figure 6.61 The sphere of radius ρ has parameterization

r⎛⎝ϕ, θ⎞⎠ = 〈 ρ cos θ sin ϕ, ρ sin θ sin ϕ, ρ cos ϕ 〉 ,
0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π, 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ π.
Finally, to parameterize the graph of a two-variable function, we first let z = f (x, y) be a function of two variables. The
simplest parameterization of the graph of f is r(x, y) = 〈 x, y, f (x, y) 〉 , where x and y vary over the domain of f
(Figure 6.62). For example, the graph of f (x, y) = x 2 y can be parameterized by r(x, y) = 〈 x, y, x 2 y 〉 , where the
parameters x and y vary over the domain of f . If we only care about a piece of the graph of f —say, the piece of the graph
over rectangle [1, 3] × ⎡⎣2, 5⎤⎦ —then we can restrict the parameter domain to give this piece of the surface:

r(x, y) = 〈 x, y, x 2 y 〉 , 1 ≤ x ≤ 3, 2 ≤ y ≤ 5.
Similarly, if S is a surface given by equation x = g(y, z) or equation y = h(x, z), then a parameterization of S is

r(y, z) = 〈 g(y, z), y, z 〉

or r(x, z) = 〈 x, h(x, z), z 〉 ,
2

respectively. For example, the graph of paraboloid
2

2y = x 2 + z 2 can be parameterized by r(x, z) = 〈 x, x + z , z 〉 , 0 ≤ x < ∞, 0 ≤ z < ∞. Notice that we do not need
2
to vary over the entire domain of y because x and z are squared.

759

Figure 6.62 The simplest parameterization of the graph of a
function is r(x, y) = 〈 x, y, f (x, y) 〉 .

Let’s now generalize the notions of smoothness and regularity to a parametric surface. Recall that curve parameterization
r(t), a ≤ t ≤ b is regular if r′(t) ≠ 0 for all t in [a, b]. For a curve, this condition ensures that the image of r really is
a curve, and not just a point. For example, consider curve parameterization r(t) = 〈 1, 2 〉 , 0 ≤ t ≤ 5. The image of this
parameterization is simply point (1, 2), which is not a curve. Notice also that r′(t) = 0. The fact that the derivative is
zero indicates we are not actually looking at a curve.
Analogously, we would like a notion of regularity for surfaces so that a surface parameterization really does trace out a
surface. To motivate the definition of regularity of a surface parameterization, consider parameterization

r(u, v) = 〈 0, cos v, 1 〉 , 0 ≤ u ≤ 1, 0 ≤ v ≤ π.
Although this parameterization appears to be the parameterization of a surface, notice that the image is actually a line
(Figure 6.63). How could we avoid parameterizations such as this? Parameterizations that do not give an actual surface?
Notice that r u = 〈 0, 0, 0 〉 and r v = 〈 0, −sin v, 0 〉 , and the corresponding cross product is zero. The analog
of the condition r′(t) = 0 is that r u × r v is not zero for point (u, v) in the parameter domain, which is a regular
parameterization.

760

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

Figure 6.63 The image of parameterization

r(u, v) = 〈 0, cos v, 1 〉 , 0 ≤ u ≤ 1, 0 ≤ v ≤ π is a line.

Definition
Parameterization r(u, v) = 〈 x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v) 〉 is a regular parameterization if r u × r v is not zero for
point (u, v) in the parameter domain.
If parameterization r is regular, then the image of r is a two-dimensional object, as a surface should be. Throughout this
chapter, parameterizations r(u, v) = 〈 x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v) 〉 are assumed to be regular.
Recall that curve parameterization r(t), a ≤ t ≤ b is smooth if r′(t) is continuous and r′(t) ≠ 0 for all t in [a, b].
Informally, a curve parameterization is smooth if the resulting curve has no sharp corners. The definition of a smooth surface
parameterization is similar. Informally, a surface parameterization is smooth if the resulting surface has no sharp corners.

Definition
A surface parameterization r(u, v) = 〈 x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v) 〉 is smooth if vector r u × r v is not zero for any
choice of u and v in the parameter domain.
A surface may also be piecewise smooth if it has smooth faces but also has locations where the directional derivatives do
not exist.

r(u, v) = 〈 (2 + cos v)cos u, (2 + cos v)sin u, sin v 〉 , 0 ≤ u < 2π, 0 ≤ v < 2π
(we can use technology to verify). Notice that vectors

r u = 〈 −(2 + cos v)sin u, (2 + cos v)cos u, 0 〉 and r v = 〈 −sin v cos u, −sin v sin u, cos v 〉
exist for any choice of u and v in the parameter domain, and

The k component of this vector is zero only if v = 0 or v = π. If v = 0 or v = π, then the only choices for u
that make the j component zero are u = 0 or u = π. But, these choices of u do not make the i component zero.
Therefore, r u × r v is not zero for any choice of u and v in the parameter domain, and the parameterization is
smooth. Notice that the corresponding surface has no sharp corners.
In the pyramid in Figure 6.64(b), the sharpness of the corners ensures that directional derivatives do not exist at
those locations. Therefore, the pyramid has no smooth parameterization. However, the pyramid consists of four
smooth faces, and thus this surface is piecewise smooth.

Is the surface parameterization r(u, v) = 〈 u 2v, v + 1, sin u 〉 , 0 ≤ u ≤ 2, 0 ≤ v ≤ 3 smooth?

Surface Area of a Parametric Surface
Our goal is to define a surface integral, and as a first step we have examined how to parameterize a surface. The second step
is to define the surface area of a parametric surface. The notation needed to develop this definition is used throughout the
rest of this chapter.

762

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

Let S be a surface with parameterization r(u, v) = 〈 x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v) 〉 over some parameter domain D. We
assume here and throughout that the surface parameterization r(u, v) = 〈 x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v) 〉 is continuously
differentiable—meaning, each component function has continuous partial derivatives. Assume for the sake of simplicity
that D is a rectangle (although the following material can be extended to handle nonrectangular parameter domains). Divide
rectangle D into subrectangles D i j with horizontal width Δu and vertical length Δv. Suppose that i ranges from 1 to
m and j ranges from 1 to n so that D is subdivided into mn rectangles. This division of D into subrectangles gives a
corresponding division of surface S into pieces S i j. Choose point P i j in each piece S i j. Point P i j corresponds to point

(u i, v j) in the parameter domain.
Note that we can form a grid with lines that are parallel to the u-axis and the v-axis in the uv-plane. These grid lines
correspond to a set of grid curves on surface S that is parameterized by r(u, v). Without loss of generality, we assume
that P i j is located at the corner of two grid curves, as in Figure 6.65. If we think of r as a mapping from the uv-plane to

ℝ 3 , the grid curves are the image of the grid lines under r. To be precise, consider the grid lines that go through point
(u i, v j). One line is given by x = u i, y = v; the other is given by x = u, y = v j. In the first grid line, the horizontal
component is held constant, yielding a vertical line through (u i, v j). In the second grid line, the vertical component is held
constant, yielding a horizontal line through (u i, v j). The corresponding grid curves are r(u i, v) and r(u, v j), and these
curves intersect at point P i j.

Figure 6.65 Grid lines on a parameter domain correspond to grid curves on a surface.

Now consider the vectors that are tangent to these grid curves. For grid curve r(u i, v), the tangent vector at P i j is

t v ⎛⎝P i j⎞⎠ = r v ⎛⎝u i, v j⎞⎠ = 〈 x v ⎛⎝u i, v j⎞⎠, y v ⎛⎝u i, v j⎞⎠, z v ⎛⎝u i, v j⎞⎠ 〉 .
For grid curve r(u, v j), the tangent vector at P i j is

t u ⎛⎝P i j⎞⎠ = r u ⎛⎝u i, v j⎞⎠ = 〈 x u ⎛⎝u i, v j⎞⎠, y u ⎛⎝u i, v j⎞⎠, z u ⎛⎝u i, v j⎞⎠ 〉 .
If vector N = t u ⎛⎝P i j⎞⎠ × t v ⎛⎝P i j⎞⎠ exists and is not zero, then the tangent plane at P i j exists (Figure 6.66). If piece S i j is
small enough, then the tangent plane at point P i j is a good approximation of piece S i j.

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

763

Figure 6.66 If the cross product of vectors t u and t v exists, then there is a
tangent plane.

The tangent plane at P i j contains vectors t u ⎛⎝P i j⎞⎠ and t v ⎛⎝P i j⎞⎠, and therefore the parallelogram spanned by t u ⎛⎝P i j⎞⎠ and

t v ⎛⎝P i j⎞⎠ is in the tangent plane. Since the original rectangle in the uv-plane corresponding to S i j has width Δu and length

Δv, the parallelogram that we use to approximate S i j is the parallelogram spanned by Δut u ⎛⎝P i j⎞⎠ and Δvt v ⎛⎝P i j⎞⎠. In
other words, we scale the tangent vectors by the constants Δu and Δv to match the scale of the original division of
rectangles in the parameter domain. Therefore, the area of the parallelogram used to approximate the area of S i j is

ΔS i j ≈ ‖ ⎛⎝Δut u ⎛⎝P i j⎞⎠⎞⎠ × ⎛⎝Δvt v ⎛⎝P i j⎞⎠⎞⎠ ‖ = ‖ t u ⎛⎝P i j⎞⎠ × t v ⎛⎝P i j⎞⎠ ‖ ΔuΔv.
Varying point P i j over all pieces S i j and the previous approximation leads to the following definition of surface area of a
parametric surface (Figure 6.67).

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

Calculating Surface Area
Calculate the lateral surface area (the area of the “side,” not including the base) of the right circular cone with
height h and radius r.

Solution
Before calculating the surface area of this cone using Equation 6.18, we need a parameterization. We assume
this cone is in ℝ 3 with its vertex at the origin (Figure 6.68). To obtain a parameterization, let α be the angle
that is swept out by starting at the positive z-axis and ending at the cone, and let k = tan α. For a height value v
with 0 ≤ v ≤ h, the radius of the circle formed by intersecting the cone with plane z = v is kv. Therefore, a
parameterization of this cone is

s(u, v) = 〈 kv cos u, kv sin u, v 〉 , 0 ≤ u < 2π, 0 ≤ v ≤ h.
The idea behind this parameterization is that for a fixed v value, the circle swept out by letting u vary is the circle
at height v and radius kv. As v increases, the parameterization sweeps out a “stack” of circles, resulting in the
desired cone.

Figure 6.68 The right circular cone with radius r = kh and
height h has parameterization

The surface area of a right circular cone with radius r and height h is usually given as πr 2 + πr h 2 + r 2. The

Surface Integral of a Scalar-Valued Function
Now that we can parameterize surfaces and we can calculate their surface areas, we are able to define surface integrals. First,
let’s look at the surface integral of a scalar-valued function. Informally, the surface integral of a scalar-valued function is an
analog of a scalar line integral in one higher dimension. The domain of integration of a scalar line integral is a parameterized
curve (a one-dimensional object); the domain of integration of a scalar surface integral is a parameterized surface (a twodimensional object). Therefore, the definition of a surface integral follows the definition of a line integral quite closely. For
scalar line integrals, we chopped the domain curve into tiny pieces, chose a point in each piece, computed the function at
that point, and took a limit of the corresponding Riemann sum. For scalar surface integrals, we chop the domain region (no
longer a curve) into tiny pieces and proceed in the same fashion.
Let S be a piecewise smooth surface with parameterization r(u, v) = 〈 x(u, v), y(u, v), z(u, v) 〉 with parameter domain
D and let f (x, y, z) be a function with a domain that contains S. For now, assume the parameter domain D is a rectangle,
but we can extend the basic logic of how we proceed to any parameter domain (the choice of a rectangle is simply to make
the notation more manageable). Divide rectangle D into subrectangles D i j with horizontal width Δu and vertical length

Δv. Suppose that i ranges from 1 to m and j ranges from 1 to n so that D is subdivided into mn rectangles. This division
of D into subrectangles gives a corresponding division of S into pieces S i j. Choose point P i j in each piece S i j, evaluate
P i j at f , and multiply by area ΔS i j to form the Riemann sum

Again, notice the similarities between this definition and the definition of a scalar line integral. In the definition of a line
integral we chop a curve into pieces, evaluate a function at a point in each piece, and let the length of the pieces shrink to
zero by taking the limit of the corresponding Riemann sum. In the definition of a surface integral, we chop a surface into
pieces, evaluate a function at a point in each piece, and let the area of the pieces shrink to zero by taking the limit of the
corresponding Riemann sum. Thus, a surface integral is similar to a line integral but in one higher dimension.
The definition of a scalar line integral can be extended to parameter domains that are not rectangles by using the same logic
used earlier. The basic idea is to chop the parameter domain into small pieces, choose a sample point in each piece, and so
on. The exact shape of each piece in the sample domain becomes irrelevant as the areas of the pieces shrink to zero.
Scalar surface integrals are difficult to compute from the definition, just as scalar line integrals are. To develop a method
that makes surface integrals easier to compute, we approximate surface areas ΔS i j with small pieces of a tangent plane,
just as we did in the previous subsection. Recall the definition of vectors t u and t v :

∂y ∂z
∂y ∂z
tu = 〈 ∂ x,

∬ f (x, y, z)dS = ∬ f (r(u, v)) ‖ t u × t v ‖ dA.

(6.19)

D

Equation 6.19 allows us to calculate a surface integral by transforming it into a double integral. This equation for surface
integrals is analogous to Equation 6.20 for line integrals:
b

∬ f (x, y, z)ds = ∫ f (r(t)) ‖ r′(t) ‖ dt.
C

a

In this case, vector t u × t v is perpendicular to the surface, whereas vector r′(t) is tangent to the curve.

Solution
Notice that this parameter domain D is a triangle, and therefore the parameter domain is not rectangular. This
is not an issue though, because Equation 6.19 does not place any restrictions on the shape of the parameter
domain.
To use Equation 6.19 to calculate the surface integral, we first find vector t u and t v. Note that
t u = 〈 1, 2u, 0 〉 and t v = 〈 0, 0, 1 〉 . Therefore,

disk is formed where plane z = 1 intersects sphere x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = 4, we can substitute z = 1 into equation

x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = 4:
x 2 + y 2 + 1 = 4 ⇒ x 2 + y 2 = 3.

Since we are only taking the piece of the sphere on or above plane z = 1, we have to restrict the domain of ϕ.
To see how far this angle sweeps, notice that the angle can be located in a right triangle, as shown in Figure 6.73
(the 3 comes from the fact that the base of S is a disk with radius 3). Therefore, the tangent of ϕ is 3,
which implies that ϕ is π/6. We now have a parameterization of S 2 :

r⎛⎝ϕ, θ⎞⎠ = 〈 2 cos θ sin ϕ, 2 sin θ sin ϕ, 2 cos ϕ 〉 , 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π, 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ π/3.

Scalar surface integrals have several real-world applications. Recall that scalar line integrals can be used to compute the
mass of a wire given its density function. In a similar fashion, we can use scalar surface integrals to compute the mass of
a sheet given its density function. If a thin sheet of metal has the shape of surface S and the density of the sheet at point
(x, y, z) is ρ(x, y, z), then mass m of the sheet is m = ∬ ρ(x, y, z)dS.

Calculating the Mass of a Sheet

0 ≤ y ≤ 2. If the density of the sheet is given by ρ(x, y, z) = x 2 yz, what is the mass of the sheet?
Solution
Let S be the surface that describes the sheet. Then, the mass of the sheet is given by m = ∬ x 2 yzdS.
S

To compute this surface integral, we first need a parameterization of S. Since S is given by the function
f (x, y) = 1 + x + 2y, a parameterization of S is r(x, y) = 〈 x, y, 1 + x + 2y 〉 , 0 ≤ x ≤ 4, 0 ≤ y ≤ 2.
The tangent vectors are t x = 〈 1, 0, 1 〉 and t y = 〈 1, 0, 2 〉 . Therefore, t x × t y = 〈 −1, −2, 1 〉 and

Orientation of a Surface
Recall that when we defined a scalar line integral, we did not need to worry about an orientation of the curve of integration.
The same was true for scalar surface integrals: we did not need to worry about an “orientation” of the surface of integration.

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

775

On the other hand, when we defined vector line integrals, the curve of integration needed an orientation. That is, we
needed the notion of an oriented curve to define a vector line integral without ambiguity. Similarly, when we define a
surface integral of a vector field, we need the notion of an oriented surface. An oriented surface is given an “upward” or
“downward” orientation or, in the case of surfaces such as a sphere or cylinder, an “outward” or “inward” orientation.
Let S be a smooth surface. For any point (x, y, z) on S, we can identify two unit normal vectors N and −N. If it is
possible to choose a unit normal vector N at every point (x, y, z) on S so that N varies continuously over S, then S is
“orientable.” Such a choice of unit normal vector at each point gives the orientation of a surface S. If you think of the
normal field as describing water flow, then the side of the surface that water flows toward is the “negative” side and the side
of the surface at which the water flows away is the “positive” side. Informally, a choice of orientation gives S an “outer”
side and an “inner” side (or an “upward” side and a “downward” side), just as a choice of orientation of a curve gives the
curve “forward” and “backward” directions.
Closed surfaces such as spheres are orientable: if we choose the outward normal vector at each point on the surface of the
sphere, then the unit normal vectors vary continuously. This is called the positive orientation of the closed surface (Figure
6.74). We also could choose the inward normal vector at each point to give an “inward” orientation, which is the negative
orientation of the surface.

Figure 6.74 An oriented sphere with positive orientation.

A portion of the graph of any smooth function z = f (x, y) is also orientable. If we choose the unit normal vector that
points “above” the surface at each point, then the unit normal vectors vary continuously over the surface. We could also
choose the unit normal vector that points “below” the surface at each point. To get such an orientation, we parameterize
the graph of f in the standard way: r(x, y) = 〈 x, y, f (x, y) 〉 , where x and y vary over the domain of f . Then,

t x = 〈 1, 0, f x 〉 and t y = 〈 0, 1, f y 〉 , and therefore the cross product t x × t y (which is normal to the surface at
any point on the surface) is 〈 − f x, − f y, 1 〉 . Since the z component of this vector is one, the corresponding unit normal
vector points “upward,” and the upward side of the surface is chosen to be the “positive” side.
Let S be a smooth orientable surface with parameterization r(u, v). For each point r(a, b) on the surface, vectors t u and

t v lie in the tangent plane at that point. Vector t u × t v is normal to the tangent plane at r(a, b) and is therefore normal to
S at that point. Therefore, the choice of unit normal vector

N=
gives an orientation of surface S.

The tangent vectors are t u = 〈 −r sin u, r cos u, 0 〉 and t v = 〈 0, 0, 1 〉 . To get an orientation of the
surface, we compute the unit normal vector

N=

tu × tv
.
‖ tu × tv ‖

In this case, t u × t v = 〈 r cos u, r sin u, 0 〉 and therefore

‖ t u × t v ‖ = r 2 cos 2 u + r 2 sin 2 u = r.
An orientation of the cylinder is

N(u, v) =

〈 r cos u, r sin u, 0 〉
= 〈 cos u, sin u, 0 〉 .
r

Notice that all vectors are parallel to the xy-plane, which should be the case with vectors that are normal to the
cylinder. Furthermore, all the vectors point outward, and therefore this is an outward orientation of the cylinder
(Figure 6.75).

Figure 6.75 If all the vectors normal to a cylinder point
outward, then this is an outward orientation of the cylinder.

Give the “upward” orientation of the graph of f (x, y) = xy.

Since every curve has a “forward” and “backward” direction (or, in the case of a closed curve, a clockwise and
counterclockwise direction), it is possible to give an orientation to any curve. Hence, it is possible to think of every curve
as an oriented curve. This is not the case with surfaces, however. Some surfaces cannot be oriented; such surfaces are called
nonorientable. Essentially, a surface can be oriented if the surface has an “inner” side and an “outer” side, or an “upward”
side and a “downward” side. Some surfaces are twisted in such a fashion that there is no well-defined notion of an “inner”
or “outer” side.
The classic example of a nonorientable surface is the Möbius strip. To create a Möbius strip, take a rectangular strip of paper,
give the piece of paper a half-twist, and the glue the ends together (Figure 6.76). Because of the half-twist in the strip, the
surface has no “outer” side or “inner” side. If you imagine placing a normal vector at a point on the strip and having the
vector travel all the way around the band, then (because of the half-twist) the vector points in the opposite direction when it
gets back to its original position. Therefore, the strip really only has one side.

Figure 6.76 The construction of a Möbius strip.

Since some surfaces are nonorientable, it is not possible to define a vector surface integral on all piecewise smooth surfaces.
This is in contrast to vector line integrals, which can be defined on any piecewise smooth curve.

Surface Integral of a Vector Field
With the idea of orientable surfaces in place, we are now ready to define a surface integral of a vector field. The definition
is analogous to the definition of the flux of a vector field along a plane curve. Recall that if F is a two-dimensional vector
field and C is a plane curve, then the definition of the flux of F along C involved chopping C into small pieces, choosing a
point inside each piece, and calculating F · N at the point (where N is the unit normal vector at the point). The definition of
a surface integral of a vector field proceeds in the same fashion, except now we chop surface S into small pieces, choose a
point in the small (two-dimensional) piece, and calculate F · N at the point.
To place this definition in a real-world setting, let S be an oriented surface with unit normal vector N. Let v be a velocity
field of a fluid flowing through S, and suppose the fluid has density ρ(x, y, z). Imagine the fluid flows through S, but S is
completely permeable so that it does not impede the fluid flow (Figure 6.77). The mass flux of the fluid is the rate of mass
flow per unit area. The mass flux is measured in mass per unit time per unit area. How could we calculate the mass flux of
the fluid across S?

Figure 6.77 Fluid flows across a completely permeable
surface S.

The rate of flow, measured in mass per unit time per unit area, is ρN. To calculate the mass flux across S, chop S into
small pieces S i j. If S i j is small enough, then it can be approximated by a tangent plane at some point P in S i j. Therefore,
the unit normal vector at P can be used to approximate N(x, y, z) across the entire piece S i j, because the normal vector
to a plane does not change as we move across the plane. The component of the vector ρv at P in the direction of N is

ρv · N at P. Since S i j is small, the dot product ρv · N changes very little as we vary across S i j, and therefore ρv · N
can be taken as approximately constant across S i j. To approximate the mass of fluid per unit time flowing across S i j
(and not just locally at point P), we need to multiply ⎛⎝ρv · N⎞⎠(P) by the area of S i j. Therefore, the mass of fluid per unit

778

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

time flowing across S i j in the direction of N can be approximated by ⎛⎝ρv · N⎞⎠ΔS i j, where N, ρ, and v are all evaluated
at P (Figure 6.78). This is analogous to the flux of two-dimensional vector field F across plane curve C, in which we
approximated flux across a small piece of C with the expression (F · N)Δs. To approximate the mass flux across S, form

This is a surface integral of a vector field. Letting the vector field ρv be an arbitrary vector field F leads to the following
definition.

in the direction of N can be approximated by ⎛⎝ρv · N⎞⎠ΔS i j.

Let F be a continuous vector field with a domain that contains oriented surface S with unit normal vector N. The
surface integral of F over S is

∬ F · dS = ∬ F · NdS.

Notice the parallel between this definition and the definition of vector line integral ∫ F · Nds. A surface integral of a
C

vector field is defined in a similar way to a flux line integral across a curve, except the domain of integration is a surface (a
two-dimensional object) rather than a curve (a one-dimensional object). Integral ∬ F · NdS is called the flux of F across
S

S, just as integral ∫ F · Nds is the flux of F across curve C. A surface integral over a vector field is also called a flux

Example 6.71
Calculating Mass Flow Rate
Let v(x, y, z) = 〈 2x, 2y, z 〉 represent a velocity field (with units of meters per second) of a fluid with
constant density 80 kg/m3. Let S be hemisphere x 2 + y 2 + z 2 = 9 with z ≥ 0 such that S is oriented outward.
Find the mass flow rate of the fluid across S.

Solution
A parameterization of the surface is

r⎛⎝ϕ, θ⎞⎠ = 〈 3 cos θ sin ϕ, 3 sin θ sin ϕ, 3 cos ϕ 〉 , 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π, 0 ≤ ϕ ≤ π/2.
As in Example 6.64, the tangent vectors are

t θ 〈 −3 sin θ sin ϕ, 3 cos θ sin ϕ, 0 〉 and t ϕ 〈 3 cos θ cos ϕ, 3 sin θ cos ϕ, −3 sin ϕ 〉 ,
and their cross product is

t ϕ × t θ = 〈 9 cos θ sin 2 ϕ, 9 sin θ sin 2 ϕ, 9 sin ϕ cos ϕ 〉 .
Notice that each component of the cross product is positive, and therefore this vector gives the outward
orientation. Therefore we use the orientation N = 〈 9 cos θ sin 2 ϕ, 9 sin θ sin 2 ϕ, 9 sin ϕ cos ϕ 〉 for the
sphere.

In Example 6.70, we computed the mass flux, which is the rate of mass flow per unit area. If we want to find the flow
rate (measured in volume per time) instead, we can use flux integral ∫ ∫ v • NdS, which leaves out the density. Since
S

the flow rate of a fluid is measured in volume per unit time, flow rate does not take mass into account. Therefore, we have
the following characterization of the flow rate of a fluid with velocity v across a surface S:

Flow rate of fluid ac oss S = ∫ ∫ v • dS.
S

To compute the flow rate of the fluid in Example 6.68, we simply remove the density constant, which gives a flow rate of

90π m 3 /sec.

Both mass flux and flow rate are important in physics and engineering. Mass flux measures how much mass is flowing
across a surface; flow rate measures how much volume of fluid is flowing across a surface.
In addition to modeling fluid flow, surface integrals can be used to model heat flow. Suppose that the temperature at point
(x, y, z) in an object is T(x, y, z). Then the heat flow is a vector field proportional to the negative temperature gradient
in the object. To be precise, the heat flow is defined as vector field F = −k∇ T, where the constant k is the thermal
conductivity of the substance from which the object is made (this constant is determined experimentally). The rate of heat
flow across surface S in the object is given by the flux integral

∬ F · dS = ∬ −k∇ T · dS.
S

S

Example 6.72
Calculating Heat Flow
A cast-iron solid cylinder is given by inequalities x 2 + y 2 ≤ 1,

1 ≤ z ≤ 4. The temperature at point (x, y, z)

in a region containing the cylinder is T(x, y, z) = ⎛⎝x 2 + y 2⎞⎠z. Given that the thermal conductivity of cast iron is
55, find the heat flow across the boundary of the solid if this boundary is oriented outward.

Solution
Let S denote the boundary of the object. To find the heat flow, we need to calculate flux integral ∬ −k∇ T · dS.
S

Notice that S is not a smooth surface but is piecewise smooth, since S is the union of three smooth surfaces
(the circular top and bottom, and the cylindrical side). Therefore, we calculate three separate integrals, one
for each smooth piece of S. Before calculating any integrals, note that the gradient of the temperature is

∇ T = 〈 2xz, 2yz, x 2 + y 2 〉 .

First we consider the circular bottom of the object, which we denote S 1. We can see that S 1 is a circle
of radius 1 centered at point (0, 0, 1),

sitting in plane z = 1. This surface has parameterization

r(u, v) = 〈 v cos u, v sin u, 1 〉 , 0 ≤ u < 2π, 0 ≤ v ≤ 1. Therefore,
t u = 〈 −v sin u, v cos u, 0 〉 and t v = 〈 cos u, v sin u, 0 〉 ,
and

t u × t v = 〈 0, 0, −v sin 2 u − v cos 2 u 〉 = 〈 0, 0, −v 〉 .
Since the surface is oriented outward and S 1 is the bottom of the object, it makes sense that this vector points

downward. By Equation 6.21, the heat flow across S 1 is

6.7 | Stokes’ Theorem
Learning Objectives
6.7.1 Explain the meaning of Stokes’ theorem.
6.7.2 Use Stokes’ theorem to evaluate a line integral.
6.7.3 Use Stokes’ theorem to calculate a surface integral.
6.7.4 Use Stokes’ theorem to calculate a curl.
In this section, we study Stokes’ theorem, a higher-dimensional generalization of Green’s theorem. This theorem, like the
Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals and Green’s theorem, is a generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
to higher dimensions. Stokes’ theorem relates a vector surface integral over surface S in space to a line integral around the
boundary of S. Therefore, just as the theorems before it, Stokes’ theorem can be used to reduce an integral over a geometric
object S to an integral over the boundary of S.
In addition to allowing us to translate between line integrals and surface integrals, Stokes’ theorem connects the concepts of
curl and circulation. Furthermore, the theorem has applications in fluid mechanics and electromagnetism. We use Stokes’
theorem to derive Faraday’s law, an important result involving electric fields.

Stokes’ Theorem
Stokes’ theorem says we can calculate the flux of curl F across surface S by knowing information only about the values of
F along the boundary of S. Conversely, we can calculate the line integral of vector field F along the boundary of surface S
by translating to a double integral of the curl of F over S.
Let S be an oriented smooth surface with unit normal vector N. Furthermore, suppose the boundary of S is a simple closed
curve C. The orientation of S induces the positive orientation of C if, as you walk in the positive direction around C with
your head pointing in the direction of N, the surface is always on your left. With this definition in place, we can state Stokes’
theorem.

Theorem 6.19: Stokes’ Theorem
Let S be a piecewise smooth oriented surface with a boundary that is a simple closed curve C with positive orientation
(Figure 6.79). If F is a vector field with component functions that have continuous partial derivatives on an open
region containing S, then

∫ F · dr = ∬ Scurl F · dS.
C

790

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

Figure 6.79 Stokes’ theorem relates the flux integral over the
surface to a line integral around the boundary of the surface.
Note that the orientation of the curve is positive.

Suppose surface S is a flat region in the xy-plane with upward orientation. Then the unit normal vector is k and surface
integral ∬ curl F · dS is actually the double integral ∬ curl F · kdA. In this special case, Stokes’ theorem gives
S

S

∫ F · dr = ∬ Scurl F · kdA. However, this is the flux form of Green’s theorem, which shows us that Green’s theorem is
C

a special case of Stokes’ theorem. Green’s theorem can only handle surfaces in a plane, but Stokes’ theorem can handle
surfaces in a plane or in space.
The complete proof of Stokes’ theorem is beyond the scope of this text. We look at an intuitive explanation for the truth of
the theorem and then see proof of the theorem in the special case that surface S is a portion of a graph of a function, and S,
the boundary of S, and F are all fairly tame.

Proof
First, we look at an informal proof of the theorem. This proof is not rigorous, but it is meant to give a general feeling for
why the theorem is true. Let S be a surface and let D be a small piece of the surface so that D does not share any points with
the boundary of S. We choose D to be small enough so that it can be approximated by an oriented square E. Let D inherit its
orientation from S, and give E the same orientation. This square has four sides; denote them E l, E r, E u, and E d for
the left, right, up, and down sides, respectively. On the square, we can use the flux form of Green’s theorem:

∫

F · dr = ∬ curl F · NdS = ∬ curl F · dS.
E

El + Ed + Er + Eu

E

To approximate the flux over the entire surface, we add the values of the flux on the small squares approximating small
pieces of the surface (Figure 6.80). By Green’s theorem, the flux across each approximating square is a line integral over
its boundary. Let F be an approximating square with an orientation inherited from S and with a right side E l (so F is to the
left of E). Let F r denote the right side of F ; then, E l = −F r. In other words, the right side of F is the same curve as the
left side of E, just oriented in the opposite direction. Therefore,

∫ F · dr = −∫ F · dr.
El

Fr

As we add up all the fluxes over all the squares approximating surface S, line integrals ∫ F · dr and ∫ F · dr cancel
El

Fr

each other out. The same goes for the line integrals over the other three sides of E. These three line integrals cancel out with
the line integral of the lower side of the square above E, the line integral over the left side of the square to the right of E,

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

791

and the line integral over the upper side of the square below E (Figure 6.81). After all this cancelation occurs over all the
approximating squares, the only line integrals that survive are the line integrals over sides approximating the boundary of
S. Therefore, the sum of all the fluxes (which, by Green’s theorem, is the sum of all the line integrals around the boundaries
of approximating squares) can be approximated by a line integral over the boundary of S. In the limit, as the areas of the
approximating squares go to zero, this approximation gets arbitrarily close to the flux.

Figure 6.80 Chop the surface into small pieces. The pieces
should be small enough that they can be approximated by a
square.

Figure 6.81 (a) The line integral along E l cancels out the line integral along F r
because E l = −F r. (b) The line integral along any of the sides of E cancels out with the
line integral along a side of an adjacent approximating square.

Let’s now look at a rigorous proof of the theorem in the special case that S is the graph of function z = f (x, y), where
x and y vary over a bounded, simply connected region D of finite area (Figure 6.82). Furthermore, assume that f has
continuous second-order partial derivatives. Let C denote the boundary of S and let C′ denote the boundary of D. Then, D
is the “shadow” of S in the plane and C′ is the “shadow” of C. Suppose that S is oriented upward. The counterclockwise
orientation of C is positive, as is the counterclockwise orientation of C′. Let F(x, y, z) = 〈 P, Q, R 〉 be a vector field
with component functions that have continuous partial derivatives.

Figure 6.82 D is the “shadow,” or projection, of S in the plane
and C′ is the projection of C.

We take the standard parameterization of S : x = x, y = y, z = g(x, y). The tangent vectors are t x = 〈 1, 0, g x 〉 and

t y = 〈 0, 1, g y 〉 , and therefore, t x · t y = 〈 −g x, −g y, 1 〉 . By Equation 6.19,

(0, 0), (2, 0), and (0, 2).

Applying Stokes’ Theorem
Stokes’ theorem translates between the flux integral of surface S to a line integral around the boundary of S. Therefore, the
theorem allows us to compute surface integrals or line integrals that would ordinarily be quite difficult by translating the
line integral into a surface integral or vice versa. We now study some examples of each kind of translation.

Figure 6.84 A complicated surface in a vector field.

Solution
Note that to calculate ∬ curl F · dS without using Stokes’ theorem, we would need to use Equation 6.19. Use
S

of this equation requires a parameterization of S. Surface S is complicated enough that it would be extremely
difficult to find a parameterization. Therefore, the methods we have learned in previous sections are not useful
for this problem. Instead, we use Stokes’ theorem, noting that the boundary C of the surface is merely a single
circle with radius 1.

∬ curl F · dS = ∫ F · dr,

where C has parameterization r (t) = 〈 −sin t, 0, 1 − cos t 〉 , 0 ≤ t < 2π. By Equation 6.9,

An amazing consequence of Stokes’ theorem is that if S′ is any other smooth surface with boundary C and the same

orientation as S, then ∬ curl F · dS = ∫ F · dr = 0 because Stokes’ theorem says the surface integral depends on the line
S

C

integral around the boundary only.
In Example 6.74, we calculated a surface integral simply by using information about the boundary of the surface. In
general, let S 1 and S 2 be smooth surfaces with the same boundary C and the same orientation. By Stokes’ theorem,

∬ curl F · dS = ∫ F · dr = ∬ curl F · dS.
S1

(6.23)

S2

C

Therefore, if ∬ curl F · dS is difficult to calculate but ∬ curl F · dS is easy to calculate, Stokes’ theorem allows
S1

S2

us to calculate the easier surface integral. In Example 6.74, we could have calculated ∬ curl F · dS by calculating
S

∬ curl F · dS, where S′ is the disk enclosed by boundary curve C (a much more simple surface with which to work).
S′

Equation 6.23 shows that flux integrals of curl vector fields are surface independent in the same way that line integrals
of gradient fields are path independent. Recall that if F is a two-dimensional conservative vector field defined on a simply

connected domain, f is a potential function for F, and C is a curve in the domain of F, then ∫ F · dr depends only on the
C

endpoints of C. Therefore if C′ is any other curve with the same starting point and endpoint as C (that is, C′ has the same

orientation as C), then ∫ F · dr = ∫ F · dr. In other words, the value of the integral depends on the boundary of the path
C

C′

only; it does not really depend on the path itself.
Analogously, suppose that S and S′ are surfaces with the same boundary and same orientation, and suppose that G is a threedimensional vector field that can be written as the curl of another vector field F (so that F is like a “potential field” of G).
By Equation 6.23,

∬ G · dS = ∬ curl F · dS = ∫ F · dr = ∬ curl F · dS = ∬ G · dS.

Therefore, the flux integral of G does not depend on the surface, only on the boundary of the surface. Flux integrals of

Solution
To calculate the line integral directly, we need to parameterize each side of the parallelogram separately, calculate
four separate line integrals, and add the result. This is not overly complicated, but it is time-consuming.
By contrast, let’s calculate the line integral using Stokes’ theorem. Let S denote the surface of the parallelogram.
Note that S is the portion of the graph of z = 1 − x − y for (x, y) varying over the rectangular region
with vertices (0, 0),

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

Interpretation of Curl
In addition to translating between line integrals and flux integrals, Stokes’ theorem can be used to justify the physical
interpretation of curl that we have learned. Here we investigate the relationship between curl and circulation, and we use
Stokes’ theorem to state Faraday’s law—an important law in electricity and magnetism that relates the curl of an electric
field to the rate of change of a magnetic field.
Recall that if C is a closed curve and F is a vector field defined on C, then the circulation of F around C is line integral

∫ F · dr. If F represents the velocity field of a fluid in space, then the circulation measures the tendency of the fluid to
C

move in the direction of C.
Let F be a continuous vector field and let D r be a small disk of radius r with center P 0 (Figure 6.85). If D r is small

enough, then (curl F)(P) ≈ (curl F)(P 0) for all points P in D r because the curl is continuous. Let C r be the boundary
circle of D r. By Stokes’ theorem,

F · dr = ∮ F · Tds is a measure of the tendency of the fluid to move around C r. The reason for this is that F · T

is a component of F in the direction of T, and the closer the direction of F is to T, the larger the value of F · T (remember
that if a and b are vectors and b is fixed, then the dot product a · b is maximal when a points in the same direction as b).
Therefore, if F is the velocity field of a fluid, then curl F · N is a measure of how the fluid rotates about axis N. The effect
of the curl is largest about the axis that points in the direction of N, because in this case curl F · N is as large as possible.
To see this effect in a more concrete fashion, imagine placing a tiny paddlewheel at point P 0 (Figure 6.86). The
paddlewheel achieves its maximum speed when the axis of the wheel points in the direction of curlF. This justifies the
interpretation of the curl we have learned: curl is a measure of the rotation in the vector field about the axis that points in
the direction of the normal vector N, and Stokes’ theorem justifies this interpretation.

Figure 6.86 To visualize curl at a point, imagine placing a
tiny paddlewheel at that point in the vector field.

Now that we have learned about Stokes’ theorem, we can discuss applications in the area of electromagnetism. In particular,
we examine how we can use Stokes’ theorem to translate between two equivalent forms of Faraday’s law. Before stating
the two forms of Faraday’s law, we need some background terminology.
Let C be a closed curve that models a thin wire. In the context of electric fields, the wire may be moving over time, so
we write C(t) to represent the wire. At a given time t, curve C(t) may be different from original curve C because of the
movement of the wire, but we assume that C(t) is a closed curve for all times t. Let D(t) be a surface with C(t) as its
boundary, and orient C(t) so that D(t) has positive orientation. Suppose that C(t) is in a magnetic field B(t) that can
also change over time. In other words, B has the form

B(x, y, z) = 〈 P(x, y, z), Q(x, y, z), R(x, y, z) 〉 ,
where P, Q, and R can all vary continuously over time. We can produce current along the wire by changing field B(t) (this
is a consequence of Ampere’s law). Flux ϕ(t) = ∬

B(t) · dS creates electric field E(t) that does work. The integral

D(t)

form of Faraday’s law states that

Work = ∫

E(t) · dr = −

C(t)

∂ϕ
.
∂t

In other words, the work done by E is the line integral around the boundary, which is also equal to the rate of change of the
flux with respect to time. The differential form of Faraday’s law states that

curl E = − ∂ B .
∂t
Using Stokes’ theorem, we can show that the differential form of Faraday’s law is a consequence of the integral form. By
Stokes’ theorem, we can convert the line integral in the integral form into surface integral

is in contrast to the single-variable integrals just discussed). If F and G are three-dimensional vector fields such that

curl E = − ∂ B .

In the context of electric fields, the curl of the electric field can be interpreted as the negative of the rate of change of the
corresponding magnetic field with respect to time.

Example 6.76
Using Faraday’s Law
Calculate the curl of electric field E if the corresponding magnetic field is constant field B(t) = 〈 1, −4, 2 〉 .

Solution
Since the magnetic field does not change with respect to time, − ∂ B = 0. By Faraday’s law, the curl of the

electric field is therefore also zero.

6.8 | The Divergence Theorem
Learning Objectives
6.8.1 Explain the meaning of the divergence theorem.
6.8.2 Use the divergence theorem to calculate the flux of a vector field.
6.8.3 Apply the divergence theorem to an electrostatic field.
We have examined several versions of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in higher dimensions that relate the integral
around an oriented boundary of a domain to a “derivative” of that entity on the oriented domain. In this section, we state
the divergence theorem, which is the final theorem of this type that we will study. The divergence theorem has many uses
in physics; in particular, the divergence theorem is used in the field of partial differential equations to derive equations
modeling heat flow and conservation of mass. We use the theorem to calculate flux integrals and apply it to electrostatic
fields.

Overview of Theorems
Before examining the divergence theorem, it is helpful to begin with an overview of the versions of the Fundamental
Theorem of Calculus we have discussed:
1. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:
b

∫ a f ′ (x)dx = f (b) − f (a).
This theorem relates the integral of derivative f ′ over line segment ⎡⎣a, b⎤⎦ along the x-axis to a difference of f
evaluated on the boundary.
2. The Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals:

∫ ∇ f · dr = f P 1 − f P 0 ,
⎛
⎝

C

⎛
⎝

⎞
⎠

⎞
⎠

where P 0 is the initial point of C and P 1 is the terminal point of C. The Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals
allows path C to be a path in a plane or in space, not just a line segment on the x-axis. If we think of the gradient as
a derivative, then this theorem relates an integral of derivative ∇ f over path C to a difference of f evaluated on
the boundary of C.
3. Green’s theorem, circulation form:

∬ (Q x − P y)dA = ∫ F · dr.
D

C

Since Q x − P y = curl F · k and curl is a derivative of sorts, Green’s theorem relates the integral of derivative curlF
over planar region D to an integral of F over the boundary of D.
4. Green’s theorem, flux form:

∬ (P x + Q y)dA = ∫ F · Nds.
D

C

Since P x + Q y = div F and divergence is a derivative of sorts, the flux form of Green’s theorem relates the integral
of derivative divF over planar region D to an integral of F over the boundary of D.
5. Stokes’ theorem:

∬ curl F · dS = ∫ F · dr.
S

C

If we think of the curl as a derivative of sorts, then Stokes’ theorem relates the integral of derivative curlF over

808

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

surface S (not necessarily planar) to an integral of F over the boundary of S.

Stating the Divergence Theorem
The divergence theorem follows the general pattern of these other theorems. If we think of divergence as a derivative of
sorts, then the divergence theorem relates a triple integral of derivative divF over a solid to a flux integral of F over the
boundary of the solid. More specifically, the divergence theorem relates a flux integral of vector field F over a closed surface
S to a triple integral of the divergence of F over the solid enclosed by S.

Theorem 6.20: The Divergence Theorem
Let S be a piecewise, smooth closed surface that encloses solid E in space. Assume that S is oriented outward, and let
F be a vector field with continuous partial derivatives on an open region containing E (Figure 6.87). Then

∭ div FdV = ∬ F · dS.
E

(6.24)

S

Figure 6.87 The divergence theorem relates a flux integral
across a closed surface S to a triple integral over solid E
enclosed by the surface.

Recall that the flux form of Green’s theorem states that ∬ div FdA = ∫ F · Nds. Therefore, the divergence theorem is a
D

C

version of Green’s theorem in one higher dimension.
The proof of the divergence theorem is beyond the scope of this text. However, we look at an informal proof that gives
a general feel for why the theorem is true, but does not prove the theorem with full rigor. This explanation follows the
informal explanation given for why Stokes’ theorem is true.

Proof
Let B be a small box with sides parallel to the coordinate planes inside E (Figure 6.88). Let the center of B have coordinates
(x, y, z) and suppose the edge lengths are Δx, Δy, and Δz (Figure 6.88(b)). The normal vector out of the top of the
box is k and the normal vector out of the bottom of the box is −k. The dot product of F = 〈 P, Q, R 〉 with k is R and
the dot product with −k is −R. The area of the top of the box (and the bottom of the box) ΔS is ΔxΔy.

Figure 6.88 (a) A small box B inside surface E has sides parallel to the coordinate planes. (b) Box B has
side lengths Δx, Δy, and Δz (c) If we look at the side view of B, we see that, since (x, y, z) is the
center of the box, to get to the top of the box we must travel a vertical distance of Δz/2 up from (x, y, z).
Similarly, to get to the bottom of the box we must travel a distance Δz/2 down from (x, y, z).

The flux out of the top of the box can be approximated by R⎝x, y, z + Δz ⎠ΔxΔy (Figure 6.88(c)) and the flux out of the

This approximation becomes arbitrarily close to the value of the total flux as the volume of the box shrinks to zero.
The sum of div FΔV over all the small boxes approximating E is approximately ∭ div FdV. On the other hand, the
E

sum of div FΔV over all the small boxes approximating E is the sum of the fluxes over all these boxes. Just as in the
informal proof of Stokes’ theorem, adding these fluxes over all the boxes results in the cancelation of a lot of the terms.
If an approximating box shares a face with another approximating box, then the flux over one face is the negative of the
flux over the shared face of the adjacent box. These two integrals cancel out. When adding up all the fluxes, the only flux
integrals that survive are the integrals over the faces approximating the boundary of E. As the volumes of the approximating
boxes shrink to zero, this approximation becomes arbitrarily close to the flux over S.

Solution
Let E be the solid cone enclosed by S. To verify the theorem for this example, we show that
∭ div FdV = ∬ F · dS by calculating each integral separately.

To compute the flux integral, first note that S is piecewise smooth; S can be written as a union of smooth surfaces.
Therefore, we break the flux integral into two pieces: one flux integral across the circular top of the cone and one
flux integral across the remaining portion of the cone. Call the circular top S 1 and the portion under the top S 2.
We start by calculating the flux across the circular top of the cone. Notice that S 1 has parameterization

r(u, v) = 〈 u cos v, u sin v, 1 〉 , 0 ≤ u ≤ 1, 0 ≤ v ≤ 2π.
Then, the tangent vectors are t u = 〈 cos v, sin v, 0 〉 and t v = 〈 −u cos v, u sin v, 0 〉 . Therefore, the flux
across S 1 is

We now calculate the flux over S 2. A parameterization of this surface is

The tangent vectors are t u = 〈 cos v, sin v, 1 〉 and t v = 〈 −u sin v, u cos v, 0 〉 , so the cross product is

t u × t v = 〈 −u cos v, −u sin v, u 〉 .
Notice that the negative signs on the x and y components induce the negative (or inward) orientation of the cone.
Since the surface is positively oriented, we use vector t v × t u = 〈 u cos v, u sin v, −u 〉 in the flux integral.

Verify the divergence theorem for vector field F(x, y, z) = 〈 x + y + z, y, 2x − y 〉 and surface S

given by the cylinder x 2 + y 2 = 1, 0 ≤ z ≤ 3 plus the circular top and bottom of the cylinder. Assume that S is
positively oriented.
Recall that the divergence of continuous field F at point P is a measure of the “outflowing-ness” of the field at P. If F
represents the velocity field of a fluid, then the divergence can be thought of as the rate per unit volume of the fluid flowing
out less the rate per unit volume flowing in. The divergence theorem confirms this interpretation. To see this, let P be a
point and let B r be a ball of small radius r centered at P (Figure 6.89). Let S r be the boundary sphere of B r. Since the
radius is small and F is continuous, div F(Q) ≈ div F(P) for all other points Q in the ball. Therefore, the flux across S r
can be approximated using the divergence theorem:

∬ F · dS = ∭ div FdV ≈ ∭ div F(P)dV.

Since div F(P) is a constant,

∭ div F(P)dV = div F(P)V(B r).

Therefore, flux ∬ F · dS can be approximated by div F(P)V(B r). This approximation gets better as the radius shrinks

This equation says that the divergence at P is the net rate of outward flux of the fluid per unit volume.

Using the Divergence Theorem
The divergence theorem translates between the flux integral of closed surface S and a triple integral over the solid enclosed
by S. Therefore, the theorem allows us to compute flux integrals or triple integrals that would ordinarily be difficult to
compute by translating the flux integral into a triple integral and vice versa.

Example 6.78
Applying the Divergence Theorem

Solution
We could calculate this integral without the divergence theorem, but the calculation is not straightforward because
we would have to break the flux integral into three separate integrals: one for the top of the cylinder, one for the
bottom, and one for the side. Furthermore, each integral would require parameterizing the corresponding surface,
calculating tangent vectors and their cross product, and using Equation 6.19.
By contrast, the divergence theorem allows us to calculate the single triple integral ∭ div FdV, where E is
E

the solid enclosed by the cylinder. Using the divergence theorem and converting to cylindrical coordinates, we
have

y

Figure 6.90 Vector field v = 〈 − z , xz , 0 〉 .

Solution

814

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

The flow rate of the fluid across S is ∬ v · dS. Before calculating this flux integral, let’s discuss what the value
S

of the integral should be. Based on Figure 6.90, we see that if we place this cube in the fluid (as long as the
cube doesn’t encompass the origin), then the rate of fluid entering the cube is the same as the rate of fluid exiting
the cube. The field is rotational in nature and, for a given circle parallel to the xy-plane that has a center on the
z-axis, the vectors along that circle are all the same magnitude. That is how we can see that the flow rate is the
same entering and exiting the cube. The flow into the cube cancels with the flow out of the cube, and therefore
the flow rate of the fluid across the cube should be zero.
To verify this intuition, we need to calculate the flux integral. Calculating the flux integral directly requires
breaking the flux integral into six separate flux integrals, one for each face of the cube. We also need to find
tangent vectors, compute their cross product, and use Equation 6.19. However, using the divergence theorem
makes this calculation go much more quickly:

∬ v · dS = ∭ div(v)dV
S

C

= ∭ 0 dV = 0.

Therefore the flux is zero, as expected.

Let v = 〈 xz , z , 0 〉

be the velocity field of a fluid. Let C be the solid cube given by

1 ≤ x ≤ 4, 2 ≤ y ≤ 5, 1 ≤ z ≤ 4, and let S be the boundary of this cube (see the following figure). Find the
flow rate of the fluid across S.

Example 6.79 illustrates a remarkable consequence of the divergence theorem. Let S be a piecewise, smooth closed
surface and let F be a vector field defined on an open region containing the surface enclosed by S. If F has the form
F = 〈 f (y, z), g(x, z), h(x, y) 〉 , then the divergence of F is zero. By the divergence theorem, the flux of F across S is
also zero. This makes certain flux integrals incredibly easy to calculate. For example, suppose we wanted to calculate the
flux integral ∬ F · dS where S is a cube and

yz

F = 〈 sin(y)e , x 2 z 2, cos(xy)e sin x 〉 .
Calculating the flux integral directly would be difficult, if not impossible, using techniques we studied previously. At the
very least, we would have to break the flux integral into six integrals, one for each face of the cube. But, because the
divergence of this field is zero, the divergence theorem immediately shows that the flux integral is zero.
We can now use the divergence theorem to justify the physical interpretation of divergence that we discussed earlier. Recall
that if F is a continuous three-dimensional vector field and P is a point in the domain of F, then the divergence of F at
P is a measure of the “outflowing-ness” of F at P. If F represents the velocity field of a fluid, then the divergence of F
at P is a measure of the net flow rate out of point P (the flow of fluid out of P less the flow of fluid in to P). To see
how the divergence theorem justifies this interpretation, let B r be a ball of very small radius r with center P, and assume
that B r is in the domain of F. Furthermore, assume that B r has a positive, outward orientation. Since the radius of B r
is small and F is continuous, the divergence of F is approximately constant on B r. That is, if P′ is any point in B r,
then div F(P) ≈ div F(P′). Let S r denote the boundary sphere of B r. We can approximate the flux across S r using the
divergence theorem as follows:

∬ F · dS = ∭ div F dV
Br

Sr

≈ ∭ div F(P)dV
Br

= div F(P)V(B r).
As we shrink the radius r to zero via a limit, the quantity div F(P)V(B r) gets arbitrarily close to the flux. Therefore,

div F(P) = lim

1

r → 0 V(B r)

∬ F · dS

and we can consider the divergence at P as measuring the net rate of outward flux per unit volume at P. Since “outflowingness” is an informal term for the net rate of outward flux per unit volume, we have justified the physical interpretation of
divergence we discussed earlier, and we have used the divergence theorem to give this justification.

Application to Electrostatic Fields
The divergence theorem has many applications in physics and engineering. It allows us to write many physical laws in both
an integral form and a differential form (in much the same way that Stokes’ theorem allowed us to translate between an
integral and differential form of Faraday’s law). Areas of study such as fluid dynamics, electromagnetism, and quantum
mechanics have equations that describe the conservation of mass, momentum, or energy, and the divergence theorem allows
us to give these equations in both integral and differential forms.
One of the most common applications of the divergence theorem is to electrostatic fields. An important result in this subject
is Gauss’ law. This law states that if S is a closed surface in electrostatic field E, then the flux of E across S is the total
charge enclosed by S (divided by an electric constant). We now use the divergence theorem to justify the special case of this
law in which the electrostatic field is generated by a stationary point charge at the origin.
If (x, y, z) is a point in space, then the distance from the point to the origin is r = x 2 + y 2 + z 2. Let F r denote

y

radial vector field F r = 12 〈 xr , r , rz 〉 . The vector at a given position in space points in the direction of unit radial

r
y z
x
vector 〈 r , r , r 〉 and is scaled by the quantity 1/r 2. Therefore, the magnitude of a vector at a given point is inversely

proportional to the square of the vector’s distance from the origin. Suppose we have a stationary charge of q Coulombs at
the origin, existing in a vacuum. The charge generates electrostatic field E given by

E=

q
F,
4πε 0 r

where the approximation ε 0 = 8.854 × 10 −12 farad (F)/m is an electric constant. (The constant ε 0 is a measure of the
resistance encountered when forming an electric field in a vacuum.) Notice that E is a radial vector field similar to the
gravitational field described in Example 6.6. The difference is that this field points outward whereas the gravitational field
points inward. Because

816

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

we say that electrostatic fields obey an inverse-square law. That is, the electrostatic force at a given point is inversely
proportional to the square of the distance from the source of the charge (which in this case is at the origin). Given this vector
field, we show that the flux across closed surface S is zero if the charge is outside of S, and that the flux is q/ε 0 if the charge
is inside of S. In other words, the flux across S is the charge inside the surface divided by constant ε 0. This is a special case
of Gauss’ law, and here we use the divergence theorem to justify this special case.
To show that the flux across S is the charge inside the surface divided by constant ε 0, we need two intermediate steps.
First we show that the divergence of F r is zero and then we show that the flux of F r across any smooth surface S is either
zero or 4π. We can then justify this special case of Gauss’ law.

Example 6.80
The Divergence of F r Is Zero

In other words, this theorem says that the flux of F r across any piecewise smooth closed surface S depends only on whether
the origin is inside of S.

Proof
The logic of this proof follows the logic of Example 6.46, only we use the divergence theorem rather than Green’s
theorem.
First, suppose that S does not encompass the origin. In this case, the solid enclosed by S is in the domain of F r, and since
the divergence of F r is zero, we can immediately apply the divergence theorem and find that ∬ F · dS is zero.
S

Now suppose that S does encompass the origin. We cannot just use the divergence theorem to calculate the flux, because
the field is not defined at the origin. Let S a be a sphere of radius a inside of S centered at the origin. The outward normal
vector field on the sphere, in spherical coordinates, is

t ϕ × t θ = 〈 a 2 cos θ sin 2 ϕ, a 2 sin θ sin 2 ϕ, a 2 sin ϕ cos ϕ 〉
(see Example 6.64). Therefore, on the surface of the sphere, the dot product F r · N (in spherical coordinates) is

Now, remember that we are interested in the flux across S, not necessarily the flux across S a. To calculate the flux across

by S − S a to indicate that S is oriented outward but now S a is oriented inward. We would like to apply the divergence
theorem to solid E. Notice that the divergence theorem, as stated, can’t handle a solid such as E because E has a hole.
However, the divergence theorem can be extended to handle solids with holes, just as Green’s theorem can be extended to
handle regions with holes. This allows us to use the divergence theorem in the following way. By the divergence theorem,

Therefore, we have justified the claim that we set out to justify: the flux across closed surface S is zero if the charge is
outside of S, and the flux is q/ε 0 if the charge is inside of S.
This analysis works only if there is a single point charge at the origin. In this case, Gauss’ law says that the flux of E across
S is the total charge enclosed by S. Gauss’ law can be extended to handle multiple charged solids in space, not just a single
point charge at the origin. The logic is similar to the previous analysis, but beyond the scope of this text. In full generality,
Gauss’ law states that if S is a piecewise smooth closed surface and Q is the total amount of charge inside of S, then the flux
of E across S is Q/ε 0.

Example 6.81
Using Gauss’ law
Suppose we have four stationary point charges in space, all with a charge of 0.002 Coulombs (C). The charges are
located at (0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 4), (−1, 0, 0), and (−2, −2, 2). Let E denote the electrostatic field generated by
these point charges. If S is the sphere of radius 2 oriented outward and centered at the origin, then find ∬ E · dS.
S

Solution
According to Gauss’ law, the flux of E across S is the total charge inside of S divided by the electric constant.
Since S has radius 2, notice that only two of the charges are inside of S: the charge at (0, 1, 1) and the charge at

(−1, 0, 0). Therefore, the total charge encompassed by S is 0.004 and, by Gauss’ law,
∬ E · dS =

KEY CONCEPTS
6.1 Vector Fields
• A vector field assigns a vector F(x, y) to each point (x, y) in a subset D of ℝ 2 or ℝ 3 . F(x, y, z) to each point

(x, y, z) in a subset D of ℝ 3 .
• Vector fields can describe the distribution of vector quantities such as forces or velocities over a region of the plane
or of space. They are in common use in such areas as physics, engineering, meteorology, oceanography.
• We can sketch a vector field by examining its defining equation to determine relative magnitudes in various
locations and then drawing enough vectors to determine a pattern.
• A vector field F is called conservative if there exists a scalar function f such that ∇ f = F.

6.2 Line Integrals
• Line integrals generalize the notion of a single-variable integral to higher dimensions. The domain of integration in
a single-variable integral is a line segment along the x-axis, but the domain of integration in a line integral is a curve
in a plane or in space.
• If C is a curve, then the length of C is ∫ ds.
C

• There are two kinds of line integral: scalar line integrals and vector line integrals. Scalar line integrals can be used
to calculate the mass of a wire; vector line integrals can be used to calculate the work done on a particle traveling
through a field.
• Scalar line integrals can be calculated using Equation 6.8; vector line integrals can be calculated using Equation
6.9.
• Two key concepts expressed in terms of line integrals are flux and circulation. Flux measures the rate that a field
crosses a given line; circulation measures the tendency of a field to move in the same direction as a given closed
curve.

6.3 Conservative Vector Fields
• The theorems in this section require curves that are closed, simple, or both, and regions that are connected or simply
connected.
• The line integral of a conservative vector field can be calculated using the Fundamental Theorem for Line Integrals.
This theorem is a generalization of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in higher dimensions. Using this theorem
usually makes the calculation of the line integral easier.
• Conservative fields are independent of path. The line integral of a conservative field depends only on the value of

This OpenStax book is available for free at http://cnx.org/content/col11966/1.2

Chapter 6 | Vector Calculus

827

the potential function at the endpoints of the domain curve.
• Given vector field F, we can test whether F is conservative by using the cross-partial property. If F has the crosspartial property and the domain is simply connected, then F is conservative (and thus has a potential function). If F
is conservative, we can find a potential function by using the Problem-Solving Strategy.
• The circulation of a conservative vector field on a simply connected domain over a closed curve is zero.

6.4 Green’s Theorem
• Green’s theorem relates the integral over a connected region to an integral over the boundary of the region. Green’s
theorem is a version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus in one higher dimension.
• Green’s Theorem comes in two forms: a circulation form and a flux form. In the circulation form, the integrand is
F · T. In the flux form, the integrand is F · N.
• Green’s theorem can be used to transform a difficult line integral into an easier double integral, or to transform a
difficult double integral into an easier line integral.
• A vector field is source free if it has a stream function. The flux of a source-free vector field across a closed curve
is zero, just as the circulation of a conservative vector field across a closed curve is zero.

6.5 Divergence and Curl
• The divergence of a vector field is a scalar function. Divergence measures the “outflowing-ness” of a vector field.
If v is the velocity field of a fluid, then the divergence of v at a point is the outflow of the fluid less the inflow at the
point.
• The curl of a vector field is a vector field. The curl of a vector field at point P measures the tendency of particles at
P to rotate about the axis that points in the direction of the curl at P.
• A vector field with a simply connected domain is conservative if and only if its curl is zero.

6.6 Surface Integrals
• Surfaces can be parameterized, just as curves can be parameterized. In general, surfaces must be parameterized with
two parameters.
• Surfaces can sometimes be oriented, just as curves can be oriented. Some surfaces, such as a Möbius strip, cannot
be oriented.

7.4 Series Solutions of Differential Equations

Introduction
We have already studied the basics of differential equations, including separable first-order equations. In this chapter, we
go a little further and look at second-order equations, which are equations containing second derivatives of the dependent
variable. The solution methods we examine are different from those discussed earlier, and the solutions tend to involve
trigonometric functions as well as exponential functions. Here we concentrate primarily on second-order equations with
constant coefficients.
Such equations have many practical applications. The operation of certain electrical circuits, known as
resistor–inductor–capacitor (RLC) circuits, can be described by second-order differential equations with constant
coefficients. These circuits are found in all kinds of modern electronic devices—from computers to smartphones to
televisions. Such circuits can be used to select a range of frequencies from the entire radio wave spectrum, and are they

commonly used for tuning AM/FM radios. We look at these circuits more closely in Applications.
Spring-mass systems, such as motorcycle shock absorbers, are a second common application of second-order differential
equations. For motocross riders, the suspension systems on their motorcycles are very important. The off-road courses on
which they ride often include jumps, and losing control of the motorcycle when landing could cost them the race. The
movement of the shock absorber depends on the amount of damping in the system. In this chapter, we model forced and
unforced spring-mass systems with varying amounts of damping.

7.1 | Second-Order Linear Equations
Learning Objectives
7.1.1 Recognize homogeneous and nonhomogeneous linear differential equations.
7.1.2 Determine the characteristic equation of a homogeneous linear equation.
7.1.3 Use the roots of the characteristic equation to find the solution to a homogeneous linear
equation.
7.1.4 Solve initial-value and boundary-value problems involving linear differential equations.
When working with differential equations, usually the goal is to find a solution. In other words, we want to find a function
(or functions) that satisfies the differential equation. The technique we use to find these solutions varies, depending on the
form of the differential equation with which we are working. Second-order differential equations have several important
characteristics that can help us determine which solution method to use. In this section, we examine some of these
characteristics and the associated terminology.

Homogeneous Linear Equations
Consider the second-order differential equation

xy″ + 2x 2 y′ + 5x 3 y = 0.
Notice that y and its derivatives appear in a relatively simple form. They are multiplied by functions of x, but are not raised
to any powers themselves, nor are they multiplied together. As discussed in Introduction to Differential Equations
(http://cnx.org/content/m53696/latest/) , first-order equations with similar characteristics are said to be linear. The
same is true of second-order equations. Also note that all the terms in this differential equation involve either y or one of its
derivatives. There are no terms involving only functions of x. Equations like this, in which every term contains y or one of
its derivatives, are called homogeneous.
Not all differential equations are homogeneous. Consider the differential equation

xy″ + 2x 2 y′ + 5x 3 y = x 2.
The x 2 term on the right side of the equal sign does not contain y or any of its derivatives. Therefore, this differential
equation is nonhomogeneous.

Definition
A second-order differential equation is linear if it can be written in the form

a 2 (x)y″ + a 1 (x)y′ + a 0 (x)y = r(x),

(7.1)

where a 2(x), a 1(x), a 0(x), and r(x) are real-valued functions and a 2(x) is not identically zero. If r(x) ≡ 0 —in
other words, if r(x) = 0 for every value of x—the equation is said to be a homogeneous linear equation. If r(x) ≠ 0
for some value of x, the equation is said to be a nonhomogeneous linear equation.

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

833

In linear differential equations, y and its derivatives can be raised only to the first power and they may not be multiplied
by one another. Terms involving y 2 or

y′ make the equation nonlinear. Functions of y and its derivatives, such as sin y

y′

or e , are similarly prohibited in linear differential equations.
Note that equations may not always be given in standard form (the form shown in the definition). It can be helpful to rewrite
them in that form to decide whether they are linear, or whether a linear equation is homogeneous.

Example 7.1
Classifying Second-Order Equations
Classify each of the following equations as linear or nonlinear. If the equation is linear, determine further whether
it is homogeneous or nonhomogeneous.
a.

y″ + 3x 4 y′ + x 2 y 2 = x 3

b.

(sin x)y″ + (cos x)y′ + 3y = 0

c.

4t 2 x″ + 3txx′ + 4x = 0

d.

5y″ + y = 4x 5

e.

(cos x)y″ − sin y′ + (sin x)y − cos x = 0

f.

8ty″ − 6t 2 y′ + 4ty − 3t 2 = 0

g.

sin(x 2)y″ − (cos x)y′ + x 2 y = y′ − 3

h.

y″ + 5xy′ − 3y = cos y

Solution
a. This equation is nonlinear because of the y 2 term.
b. This equation is linear. There is no term involving a power or function of y, and the coefficients are
all functions of x. The equation is already written in standard form, and r(x) is identically zero, so the
equation is homogeneous.
c. This equation is nonlinear. Note that, in this case, x is the dependent variable and t is the independent
variable. The second term involves the product of x and x′, so the equation is nonlinear.
d. This equation is linear. Since r(x) = 4x 5, the equation is nonhomogeneous.
e. This equation is nonlinear, because of the sin y′ term.
f. This equation is linear. Rewriting it in standard form gives

8t 2 y″ − 6t 2 y′ + 4ty = 3t 2.
With the equation in standard form, we can see that r(t) = 3t 2, so the equation is nonhomogeneous.
g. This equation looks like it’s linear, but we should rewrite it in standard form to be sure. We get

sin(x 2)y″ − (cos x + 1)y′ + x 2 y = −3.

834

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

This equation is, indeed, linear. With r(x) = −3, it is nonhomogeneous.
h. This equation is nonlinear because of the cos y term.

Visit this website (http://www.openstaxcollege.org/l/20_Secondord2) that discusses second-order
differential equations.

7.1 Classify each of the following equations as linear or nonlinear. If the equation is linear, determine further
whether it is homogeneous or nonhomogeneous.
a.

(y″) 2 − y′ + 8x 3 y = 0

b.

(sint)y″ + cost − 3ty′ = 0

Later in this section, we will see some techniques for solving specific types of differential equations. Before we get to
that, however, let’s get a feel for how solutions to linear differential equations behave. In many cases, solving differential
equations depends on making educated guesses about what the solution might look like. Knowing how various types of
solutions behave will be helpful.

Example 7.2
Verifying a Solution
Consider the linear, homogeneous differential equation

x 2 y″ − xy′ − 3y = 0.
Looking at this equation, notice that the coefficient functions are polynomials, with higher powers of x
associated with higher-order derivatives of y. Show that y = x 3 is a solution to this differential equation.

Solution
Let y = x 3. Then y′ = 3x 2 and y″ = 6x. Substituting into the differential equation, we see that

x 2 y″ − xy′ − 3y = x 2 (6x) − x⎛⎝3x 2⎞⎠ − 3⎛⎝x 3⎞⎠
= 6x 3 − 3x 3 − 3x 3
= 0.

7.2

Show that y = 2x 2 is a solution to the differential equation

1 x 2 y″ − xy′ + y = 0.
2
Although simply finding any solution to a differential equation is important, mathematicians and engineers often want to
go beyond finding one solution to a differential equation to finding all solutions to a differential equation. In other words,
we want to find a general solution. Just as with first-order differential equations, a general solution (or family of solutions)
gives the entire set of solutions to a differential equation. An important difference between first-order and second-order

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

835

equations is that, with second-order equations, we typically need to find two different solutions to the equation to find the
general solution. If we find two solutions, then any linear combination of these solutions is also a solution. We state this fact
as the following theorem.

Theorem 7.1: Superposition Principle
If y 1(x) and y 2(x) are solutions to a linear homogeneous differential equation, then the function

y(x) = c 1 y 1(x) + c 2 y 2(x),
where c 1 and c 2 are constants, is also a solution.

The proof of this superposition principle theorem is left as an exercise.

Example 7.3
Verifying the Superposition Principle
Consider the differential equation

y″ − 4y′ − 5y = 0.
Given that e −x and e 5x are solutions to this differential equation, show that 4e −x + e 5x is a solution.

Solution
We have

y(x) = 4e −x + e 5x, so y′(x) = −4e −x + 5e 5x and y″(x) = 4e −x + 25e 5x.
Then

y″ − 4y′ − 5y = ⎛⎝4e −x + 25e 5x⎞⎠ − 4⎛⎝−4e −x + 5e 5x⎞⎠ − 5⎛⎝4e −x + e 5x⎞⎠
= 4e −x + 25e 5x + 16e −x − 20e 5x − 20e −x − 5e 5x
= 0.
Thus, y(x) = 4e −x + e 5x is a solution.

7.3

Consider the differential equation

y″ + 5y′ + 6y = 0.
Given that e −2x and e −3x are solutions to this differential equation, show that 3e −2x + 6e −3x is a solution.
Unfortunately, to find the general solution to a second-order differential equation, it is not enough to find any two solutions
and then combine them. Consider the differential equation

x″ + 7x′ + 12x = 0.
Both e −3t and 2e −3t are solutions (check this). However, x(t) = c 1 e −3t + c 2 ⎛⎝2e −3t⎞⎠ is not the general solution. This
expression does not account for all solutions to the differential equation. In particular, it fails to account for the function
e −4t, which is also a solution to the differential equation.
It turns out that to find the general solution to a second-order differential equation, we must find two linearly independent

836

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

solutions. We define that terminology here.

Definition
A set of functions f 1(x), f 2(x),…, f n(x) is said to be linearly dependent if there are constants c 1, c 2 ,…c n, not all

zero, such that c 1 f 1(x) + c 2 f 2(x) + ⋯ + c n f n(x) = 0 for all x over the interval of interest. A set of functions that is
not linearly dependent is said to be linearly independent.
In this chapter, we usually test sets of only two functions for linear independence, which allows us to simplify this definition.
From a practical perspective, we see that two functions are linearly dependent if either one of them is identically zero or if
they are constant multiples of each other.
First we show that if the functions meet the conditions given previously, then they are linearly dependent. If one of the
functions is identically zero—say, f 2(x) ≡ 0 —then choose c 1 = 0 and c 2 = 1, and the condition for linear dependence

is satisfied. If, on the other hand, neither f 1(x) nor f 2(x) is identically zero, but f 1(x) = C f 2(x) for some constant C,
then choose c 1 = 1 and c 2 = −1, and again, the condition is satisfied.

C

Next, we show that if two functions are linearly dependent, then either one is identically zero or they are constant multiples
of one another. Assume f 1(x) and f 2(x) are linearly independent. Then, there are constants, c 1 and c 2, not both zero,
such that

c 1 f 1(x) + c 2 f 2(x) = 0
for all x over the interval of interest. Then,

c 1 f 1(x) = −c 2 f 2(x).
Now, since we stated that c 1 and c 2 can’t both be zero, assume c 2 ≠ 0. Then, there are two cases: either c 1 = 0 or

c 1 ≠ 0. If c 1 = 0, then

0 = −c 2 f 2(x)
0 = f 2(x),
so one of the functions is identically zero. Now suppose c 1 ≠ 0. Then,

⎛ c ⎞
f 1(x) = ⎝− c 2 ⎠ f 2(x)
1

and we see that the functions are constant multiples of one another.

Theorem 7.2: Linear Dependence of Two Functions
Two functions, f 1(x) and f 2(x), are said to be linearly dependent if either one of them is identically zero or if
f 1(x) = C f 2(x) for some constant C and for all x over the interval of interest. Functions that are not linearly dependent
are said to be linearly independent.

Example 7.4
Testing for Linear Dependence
Determine whether the following pairs of functions are linearly dependent or linearly independent.

a.

f 1(x) = x 2,

f 2(x) = e −3x

d.

f 2(x) = 3x + 1

837

f 2(x) = 5x 2

Solution
a.

f 2(x) = 5 f 1(x), so the functions are linearly dependent.

b. There is no constant C such that f 1(x) = C f 2(x), so the functions are linearly independent.
c. There is no constant C such that f 1(x) = C f 2(x), so the functions are linearly independent. Don’t
get confused by the fact that the exponents are constant multiples of each other. With two exponential
functions, unless the exponents are equal, the functions are linearly independent.
d. There is no constant C such that f 1(x) = C f 2(x), so the functions are linearly independent.

7.4 Determine whether the following pairs of functions are linearly dependent or linearly independent:
f 1(x) = e x, f 2(x) = 3e 3x.
If we are able to find two linearly independent solutions to a second-order differential equation, then we can combine them
to find the general solution. This result is formally stated in the following theorem.

Theorem 7.3: General Solution to a Homogeneous Equation
If y 1(x) and y 2(x) are linearly independent solutions to a second-order, linear, homogeneous differential equation,
then the general solution is given by

y(x) = c 1 y 1(x) + c 2 y 2(x),
where c 1 and c 2 are constants.

When we say a family of functions is the general solution to a differential equation, we mean that (1) every expression
of that form is a solution and (2) every solution to the differential equation can be written in that form, which makes
this theorem extremely powerful. If we can find two linearly independent solutions to a differential equation, we have,
effectively, found all solutions to the differential equation—quite a remarkable statement. The proof of this theorem is
beyond the scope of this text.

Example 7.5
Writing the General Solution

Solution

838

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

Note that y 1 and y 2 are not constant multiples of one another, so they are linearly independent. Then, the general
solution to the differential equation is y(t) = c 1 e 3t + c 2 e −3t.

7.5

If y 1(x) = e 3x and y 2(x) = xe 3x are solutions to y″ − 6y′ + 9y = 0, what is the general solution?

Second-Order Equations with Constant Coefficients
Now that we have a better feel for linear differential equations, we are going to concentrate on solving second-order
equations of the form

ay″ + by′ + cy = 0,
where a,

(7.2)

b, and c are constants.

Since all the coefficients are constants, the solutions are probably going to be functions with derivatives that are constant
multiples of themselves. We need all the terms to cancel out, and if taking a derivative introduces a term that is not a constant
multiple of the original function, it is difficult to see how that term cancels out. Exponential functions have derivatives that
are constant multiples of the original function, so let’s see what happens when we try a solution of the form y(x) = e λx,
where λ (the lowercase Greek letter lambda) is some constant.
If y(x) = e λx, then y′(x) = λe λx and y″ = λ 2 e λx. Substituting these expressions into Equation 7.1, we get

ay″ + by′ + cy = a(λ 2 e λx) + b(λe λx) + ce λx
= e λx(aλ 2 + bλ + c).
Since e λx is never zero, this expression can be equal to zero for all x only if

aλ 2 + bλ + c = 0.
We call this the characteristic equation of the differential equation.

Definition
The characteristic equation of the differential equation ay″ + by′ + cy = 0 is aλ 2 + bλ + c = 0.
The characteristic equation is very important in finding solutions to differential equations of this form. We can solve the
characteristic equation either by factoring or by using the quadratic formula
2
λ = −b ± b − 4ac .
2a

This gives three cases. The characteristic equation has (1) distinct real roots; (2) a single, repeated real root; or (3) complex
conjugate roots. We consider each of these cases separately.

Distinct Real Roots
λ x

λ x

If the characteristic equation has distinct real roots λ 1 and λ 2, then e 1 and e 2 are linearly independent solutions to
Example 7.1, and the general solution is given by
λ x

λ x

y(x) = c 1 e 1 + c 2 e 2 ,

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

839

where c 1 and c 2 are constants.
For example, the differential equation y″ + 9y′ + 14y = 0 has the associated characteristic equation λ 2 + 9λ + 14 = 0.
This factors into (λ + 2)(λ + 7) = 0, which has roots λ 1 = −2 and λ 2 = −7. Therefore, the general solution to this
differential equation is

y(x) = c 1 e −2x + c 2 e −7x.
Single Repeated Real Root
Things are a little more complicated if the characteristic equation has a repeated real root, λ. In this case, we know e λx
is a solution to Equation 7.1, but it is only one solution and we need two linearly independent solutions to determine the
general solution. We might be tempted to try a function of the form ke λx, where k is some constant, but it would not be
linearly independent of e λx. Therefore, let’s try xe λx as the second solution. First, note that by the quadratic formula,
2
λ = −b ± b − 4ac .
2a

But, λ is a repeated root, so b 2 − 4ac = 0 and λ = −b . Thus, if y = xe λx, we have

2a

y′ = e λx + λxe λx and y″ = 2λe λx + λ 2 xe λx.
Substituting these expressions into Equation 7.1, we see that

ay″ + by′ + cy = a(2λe λx + λ 2 xe λx) + b(e λx + λxe λx) + cxe λx
= xe λx(aλ 2 + bλ + c) + e λx(2aλ + b)
⎞
⎛ ⎛ ⎞
= xe λx(0) + e λx ⎝2a⎝−b ⎠ + b⎠
2a
= 0 + e λx (0)
= 0.
This shows that xe λx is a solution to Equation 7.1. Since e λx and xe λx are linearly independent, when the characteristic
equation has a repeated root λ, the general solution to Equation 7.1 is given by

y(x) = c 1 e λx + c 2 xe λx,
where c 1 and c 2 are constants.
For

example,

the

differential

equation

y″ + 12y′ + 36y = 0

has

the

associated

characteristic

equation

λ 2 + 12λ + 36 = 0. This factors into (λ + 6) 2 = 0, which has a repeated root λ = −6. Therefore, the general solution
to this differential equation is

y(x) = c 1 e −6x + c 2 xe −6x.
Complex Conjugate Roots
The third case we must consider is when b 2 − 4ac < 0. In this case, when we apply the quadratic formula, we are taking
the square root of a negative number. We must use the imaginary number i = −1 to find the roots, which take the form
λ 1 = α + βi and λ 2 = α − βi. The complex number α + βi is called the conjugate of α − βi. Thus, we see that when

b 2 − 4ac < 0, the roots of our characteristic equation are always complex conjugates.
This creates a little bit of a problem for us. If we follow the same process we used for distinct real roots—using the roots
of the characteristic equation as the coefficients in the exponents of exponential functions—we get the functions e
(α − βi)x

as our solutions. However, there are problems with this approach. First, these functions take on complex
(imaginary) values, and a complete discussion of such functions is beyond the scope of this text. Second, even if we were
comfortable with complex-value functions, in this course we do not address the idea of a derivative for such functions. So,

if possible, we’d like to find two linearly independent real-value solutions to the differential equation. For purposes of this

development, we are going to manipulate and differentiate the functions e
and e
as if they were real-value
functions. For these particular functions, this approach is valid mathematically, but be aware that there are other instances
when complex-value functions do not follow the same rules as real-value functions. Those of you interested in a more indepth discussion of complex-value functions should consult a complex analysis text.
Based on the roots α ± βi of the characteristic equation, the functions e

(α + βi)x

and e

(α − βi)x

are linearly independent

solutions to the differential equation. and the general solution is given by

y(x) = c 1 e

(α + βi)x

+ c2 e

(α − βi)x

.

Using some smart choices for c 1 and c 2, and a little bit of algebraic manipulation, we can find two linearly independent,
real-value solutions to Equation 7.1 and express our general solution in those terms.
We encountered exponential functions with complex exponents earlier. One of the key tools we used to express these
exponential functions in terms of sines and cosines was Euler’s formula, which tells us that

e iθ = cosθ + isinθ
for all real numbers θ.
Going back to the general solution, we have

y(x) = c 1 e

(α + βi)x

= c 1 e αx e

Applying Euler’s formula together with the identities cos(−x) = cos x and sin(−x) = −sin x, we get

y(x) = e αx ⎡⎣c 1 ⎛⎝cos βx + isin βx⎞⎠ + c 2 ⎛⎝cos(−βx) + isin(−βx)⎞⎠⎤⎦
= e αx ⎡⎣(c 1 + c 2)cos βx + (c 1 − c 2)isin βx⎤⎦.

Now, if we choose c 1 = c 2 = 1 , the second term is zero and we get

y(x) = e αx cos βx
as a real-value solution to Equation 7.1. Similarly, if we choose c 1 = − i and c 2 = i , the first term is zero and we get

2

y(x) = e αx sin βx
as a second, linearly independent, real-value solution to Equation 7.1.
Based on this, we see that if the characteristic equation has complex conjugate roots α ± βi, then the general solution to
Equation 7.1 is given by

y(x) = c 1 e αx cos βx + c 2 e αx sin βx
= e αx ⎛⎝c 1 cos βx + c 2 sin βx⎞⎠,

where c 1 and c 2 are constants.
For example, the differential equation y″ − 2y′ + 5y = 0 has the associated characteristic equation λ 2 − 2λ + 5 = 0. By
the quadratic formula, the roots of the characteristic equation are 1 ± 2i. Therefore, the general solution to this differential
equation is

y(x) = e x ⎛⎝c 1 cos2x + c 2 sin2x⎞⎠.

Solving Second-Order Equations with Constant Coefficients
Find the general solution to the following differential equations. Give your answers as functions of x.
a.

y″ + 3y′ − 4y = 0

b.

y″ + 6y′ + 13y = 0

y″ − 5y′ = 0

e.

y″ − 16y = 0

f.

y″ + 16y = 0

Solution
Note that all these equations are already given in standard form (step 1).
a. The characteristic equation is λ 2 + 3λ − 4 = 0 (step 2). This factors into (λ + 4)(λ − 1) = 0, so the
roots of the characteristic equation are λ 1 = −4 and λ 2 = 1 (step 3). Then the general solution to the
differential equation is

842

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

y(x) = c 1 e −4x + c 2 e x (step 4).
b. The characteristic equation is λ 2 + 6λ + 13 = 0 (step 2). Applying the quadratic formula, we see this
equation has complex conjugate roots −3 ± 2i (step 3). Then the general solution to the differential
equation is

y(t) = e −3t ⎛⎝c 1 cos2t + c 2 sin2t⎞⎠ (step 4).
c. The characteristic equation is λ 2 + 2λ + 1 = 0 (step 2). This factors into (λ + 1) 2 = 0,

so the

characteristic equation has a repeated real root λ = −1 (step 3). Then the general solution to the
differential equation is

y(t) = c 1 e −t + c 2 te −t (step 4).
d. The characteristic equation is λ 2 − 5λ (step 2). This factors into λ(λ − 5) = 0, so the roots of the
characteristic equation are λ 1 = 0 and λ 2 = 5 (step 3). Note that e 0x = e 0 = 1, so our first solution
is just a constant. Then the general solution to the differential equation is

y(x) = c 1 + c 2 e 5x (step 4).
e. The characteristic equation is λ 2 − 16 = 0 (step 2). This factors into (λ + 4)(λ − 4) = 0, so the roots
of the characteristic equation are λ 1 = 4 and λ 2 = −4 (step 3). Then the general solution to the
differential equation is

y(x) = c 1 e 4x + c 2 e −4x (step 4).
f. The characteristic equation is λ 2 + 16 = 0 (step 2). This has complex conjugate roots ±4i (step 3).
Note that e 0x = e 0 = 1, so the exponential term in our solution is just a constant. Then the general
solution to the differential equation is

y(t) = c 1 cos4t + c 2 sin4t (step 4).

Initial-Value Problems and Boundary-Value Problems
So far, we have been finding general solutions to differential equations. However, differential equations are often used to
describe physical systems, and the person studying that physical system usually knows something about the state of that
system at one or more points in time. For example, if a constant-coefficient differential equation is representing how far a
motorcycle shock absorber is compressed, we might know that the rider is sitting still on his motorcycle at the start of a
race, time t = t 0. This means the system is at equilibrium, so y(t 0) = 0, and the compression of the shock absorber is
not changing, so y′(t 0) = 0. With these two initial conditions and the general solution to the differential equation, we can
find the specific solution to the differential equation that satisfies both initial conditions. This process is known as solving
an initial-value problem. (Recall that we discussed initial-value problems in Introduction to Differential Equations
(http://cnx.org/content/m53696/latest/) .) Note that second-order equations have two arbitrary constants in the general
solution, and therefore we require two initial conditions to find the solution to the initial-value problem.
Sometimes we know the condition of the system at two different times. For example, we might know y(t 0) = y 0 and

y(t 1) = y 1. These conditions are called boundary conditions, and finding the solution to the differential equation that
satisfies the boundary conditions is called solving a boundary-value problem.
Mathematicians, scientists, and engineers are interested in understanding the conditions under which an initial-value
problem or a boundary-value problem has a unique solution. Although a complete treatment of this topic is beyond the
scope of this text, it is useful to know that, within the context of constant-coefficient, second-order equations, initial-value
problems are guaranteed to have a unique solution as long as two initial conditions are provided. Boundary-value problems,
however, are not as well behaved. Even when two boundary conditions are known, we may encounter boundary-value
problems with unique solutions, many solutions, or no solution at all.

Example 7.7
Solving an Initial-Value Problem
Solve the following initial-value problem: y″ + 3y′ − 4y = 0,

y(0) = 1, y′(0) = −9.

Solution
We already solved this differential equation in Example 7.6a. and found the general solution to be

y(x) = c 1 e −4x + c 2 e x.
Then

y′(x) = −4c 1 e −4x + c 2 e x.
When x = 0, we have y(0) = c 1 + c 2 and y′(0) = −4c 1 + c 2. Applying the initial conditions, we have

c1 + c2 = 1

−4c 1 + c 2 = −9.
Then c 1 = 1 − c 2. Substituting this expression into the second equation, we see that

−4(1 − c 2) + c 2
−4 + 4c 2 + c 2
5c 2

So, c 1 = 2 and the solution to the initial-value problem is

y(x) = 2e −4x − e x.

y(0) = 0,

y′(0) = 7.

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

Solution
We already solved this differential equation in Example 7.6b. and found the general solution to be

y(x) = e −3x ⎛⎝c 1 cos2x + c 2 sin2x⎞⎠.
Then

y′(x) = e −3x ⎛⎝−2c 1 sin2x + 2c 2 cos2x⎞⎠ − 3e −3x ⎛⎝c 1 cos2x + c 2 sin2x⎞⎠.
When x = 0, we have y(0) = c 1 and y′(0) = 2c 2 − 3c 1. Applying the initial conditions, we obtain

c1 = 0
−3c 1 + 2c 2 = 2.
Therefore, c 1 = 0,

c 2 = 1, and the solution to the initial value problem is shown in the following graph.

Initial-Value Problem Representing a Spring-Mass System
The following initial-value problem models the position of an object with mass attached to a spring. Spring-mass
systems are examined in detail in Applications. The solution to the differential equation gives the position of
the mass with respect to a neutral (equilibrium) position (in meters) at any given time. (Note that for spring-mass
systems of this type, it is customary to define the downward direction as positive.)

Solve the initial-value problem and graph the solution. What is the position of the mass at time t = 2 sec? How
fast is the mass moving at time t = 1 sec? In what direction?

Solution
In Example 7.6c. we found the general solution to this differential equation to be

y(t) = c 1 e −t + c 2 te −t.

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

845

Then

y′(t) = −c 1 e −t + c 2 ⎛⎝−te −t + e −t⎞⎠.
When t = 0, we have y(0) = c 1 and y′(0) = −c 1 + c 2. Applying the initial conditions, we obtain

c1 = 1
−c 1 + c 2 = 0.
Thus, c 1 = 1,

c 2 = 1, and the solution to the initial value problem is
y(t) = e −t + te −t.

This solution is represented in the following graph. At time

t = 2,

the mass is at position

≈ 0.406 m below equilibrium.

To calculate the velocity at time t = 1, we need to find the derivative. We have y(t) = e −t + te −t, so

y′(t) = −e −t + e −t − te −t = −te −t.
Then y′(1) = −e −1 ≈ − 0.3679. At time t = 1, the mass is moving upward at 0.3679 m/sec.

7.9 Suppose the following initial-value problem models the position (in feet) of a mass in a spring-mass
system at any given time. Solve the initial-value problem and graph the solution. What is the position of the
mass at time t = 0.3 sec? How fast is it moving at time t = 0.1 sec? In what direction?

Example 7.10
Solving a Boundary-Value Problem

Solution
We have

y(x) = c 1 cos4t + c 2 sin4t.

a. Applying the first boundary condition given here, we get y(0) = c 1 = 0. So the solution is of the
form

y(t) = c 2 sin4t.

When we apply the second boundary condition, though, we get

y⎝π ⎠ = c 2 sin ⎝4⎝π ⎠⎠ = c 2 sinπ = 0 for all values of c 2. The boundary conditions are not sufficient

to determine a value for c 2,

so this boundary-value problem has infinitely many solutions. Thus,

y(t) = c 2 sin4t is a solution for any value of c 2.

b. Applying the first boundary condition given here, we get y(0) = c 1 = 1. Applying the second boundary

7.2 | Nonhomogeneous Linear Equations
Learning Objectives
7.2.1 Write the general solution to a nonhomogeneous differential equation.
7.2.2 Solve a nonhomogeneous differential equation by the method of undetermined
coefficients.
7.2.3 Solve a nonhomogeneous differential equation by the method of variation of parameters.
In this section, we examine how to solve nonhomogeneous differential equations. The terminology and methods are
different from those we used for homogeneous equations, so let’s start by defining some new terms.

General Solution to a Nonhomogeneous Linear Equation
Consider the nonhomogeneous linear differential equation

a 2 (x)y″ + a 1 (x)y′ + a 0 (x)y = r(x).
The associated homogeneous equation

a 2 (x)y″ + a 1 (x)y′ + a 0 (x)y = 0

(7.3)

is called the complementary equation. We will see that solving the complementary equation is an important step in solving
a nonhomogeneous differential equation.

Definition
A solution y p(x) of a differential equation that contains no arbitrary constants is called a particular solution to the
equation.

Theorem 7.4: General Solution to a Nonhomogeneous Equation
Let y p(x) be any particular solution to the nonhomogeneous linear differential equation

a 2 (x)y″ + a 1 (x)y′ + a 0 (x)y = r(x).
Also, let c 1 y 1(x) + c 2 y 2(x) denote the general solution to the complementary equation. Then, the general solution to
the nonhomogeneous equation is given by

y(x) = c 1 y 1(x) + c 2 y 2(x) + y p(x).

(7.4)

Proof
To prove y(x) is the general solution, we must first show that it solves the differential equation and, second, that any
solution to the differential equation can be written in that form. Substituting y(x) into the differential equation, we have

a 2(x)y″ + a 1(x)y′ + a 0(x)y = a 2(x)⎛⎝c 1 y 1 + c 2 y 2 + y p⎞⎠″ + a 1(x)⎛⎝c 1 y 1 + c 2 y 2 + y p⎞⎠′
+a 0(x)⎛⎝c 1 y 1 + c 2 y 2 + y p⎞⎠

= ⎡⎣a 2(x)(c 1 y 1 + c 2 y 2)″ + a 1(x)(c 1 y 1 + c 2 y 2)′ + a 0(x)(c 1 y 1 + c 2 y 2)⎤⎦
+a 2(x)y p ″ + a 1(x)y p ′ + a 0(x)y p
= 0 + r(x)
= r(x).

So y(x) is a solution.

850

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

Now, let z(x) be any solution to a 2 (x)y″ + a 1 (x)y′ + a 0 (x)y = r(x). Then

a 2(x)(z − y p)″ + a 1(x)(z − y p)′ + a 0(x)(z − y p) = ⎛⎝a 2(x)z″ + a 1(x)z′ + a 0(x)z⎞⎠

− ⎛⎝a 2(x)y p ″ + a 1(x)y p ′ + a 0(x)y p⎞⎠

= r(x) − r(x)
= 0,

so z(x) − y p(x) is a solution to the complementary equation. But, c 1 y 1(x) + c 2 y 2(x) is the general solution to the
complementary equation, so there are constants c 1 and c 2 such that

z(x) − y p(x) = c 1 y 1(x) + c 2 y 2(x).
Hence, we see that z(x) = c 1 y 1(x) + c 2 y 2(x) + y p(x).
□

Example 7.11
Verifying the General Solution
Given that y p(x) = x is a particular solution to the differential equation y″ + y = x, write the general solution
and check by verifying that the solution satisfies the equation.

Solution
The complementary equation is y″ + y = 0, which has the general solution c 1 cos x + c 2 sin x. So, the general
solution to the nonhomogeneous equation is

y(x) = c 1 cos x + c 2 sin x + x.
To verify that this is a solution, substitute it into the differential equation. We have

y′(x) = −c 1 sin x + c 2 cos x + 1 and y″(x) = −c 1 cos x − c 2 sin x.
Then

y″(x) + y(x) = −c 1 cos x − c 2 sin x + c 1 cos x + c 2 sin x + x
= x.
So, y(x) is a solution to y″ + y = x.

Given that y p(x) = −2 is a particular solution to y″ − 3y′ − 4y = 8, write the general solution and

verify that the general solution satisfies the equation.
In the preceding section, we learned how to solve homogeneous equations with constant coefficients. Therefore, for
nonhomogeneous equations of the form ay″ + by′ + cy = r(x), we already know how to solve the complementary
equation, and the problem boils down to finding a particular solution for the nonhomogeneous equation. We now examine
two techniques for this: the method of undetermined coefficients and the method of variation of parameters.

Undetermined Coefficients
The method of undetermined coefficients involves making educated guesses about the form of the particular solution
based on the form of r(x). When we take derivatives of polynomials, exponential functions, sines, and cosines, we get
polynomials, exponential functions, sines, and cosines. So when r(x) has one of these forms, it is possible that the solution

851

to the nonhomogeneous differential equation might take that same form. Let’s look at some examples to see how this works.

Example 7.12
Undetermined Coefficients When r(x) Is a Polynomial
Find the general solution to y″ + 4y′ + 3y = 3x.

Solution
with general solution c 1 e −x + c 2 e −3x. Since
r(x) = 3x, the particular solution might have the form y p(x) = Ax + B. If this is the case, then we have

The complementary equation is

y″ + 4y′ + 3y = 0,

y p ′(x) = A and y p ″(x) = 0. For y p to be a solution to the differential equation, we must find values for A
and B such that

y″ + 4y′ + 3y = 3x
0 + 4(A) + 3(Ax + B) = 3x
3Ax + (4A + 3B) = 3x.
Setting coefficients of like terms equal, we have

3A = 3
4A + 3B = 0.
Then, A = 1 and B = − 4 , so y p(x) = x − 4 and the general solution is

3

3

y(x) = c 1 e −x + c 2 e −3x + x − 4 .
3

In Example 7.12, notice that even though r(x) did not include a constant term, it was necessary for us to include the
constant term in our guess. If we had assumed a solution of the form y p = Ax (with no constant term), we would not have
been able to find a solution. (Verify this!) If the function r(x) is a polynomial, our guess for the particular solution should
be a polynomial of the same degree, and it must include all lower-order terms, regardless of whether they are present in

r(x).

Example 7.13
Undetermined Coefficients When r(x) Is an Exponential
Find the general solution to y″ − y′ − 2y = 2e 3x.

Solution
The complementary equation is y″ − y′ − 2y = 0,

with the general solution c 1 e −x + c 2 e 2x. Since

r(x) = 2e 3x, the particular solution might have the form y p(x) = Ae 3x. Then, we have y p ′(x) = 3Ae 3x and
y p ″(x) = 9Ae 3x. For y p to be a solution to the differential equation, we must find a value for A such that

852

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

y″ − y′ − 2y = 2e 3x
9Ae 3x − 3Ae 3x − 2Ae 3x = 2e 3x
4Ae 3x = 2e 3x.
⎛ ⎞

So, 4A = 2 and A = 1/2. Then, y p(x) = ⎝1 ⎠e 3x, and the general solution is

y(x) = c 1 e −x + c 2 e 2x + 1 e 3x.

In the previous checkpoint, r(x) included both sine and cosine terms. However, even if r(x) included a sine term only
or a cosine term only, both terms must be present in the guess. The method of undetermined coefficients also works with
products of polynomials, exponentials, sines, and cosines. Some of the key forms of r(x) and the associated guesses for

y p(x) are summarized in Table 7.2.

Table 7.2 Key Forms for the Method of Undetermined Coefficients
Keep in mind that there is a key pitfall to this method. Consider the differential equation y″ + 5y′ + 6y = 3e −2x. Based on
the form of r(x), we guess a particular solution of the form y p(x) = Ae −2x. But when we substitute this expression into
the differential equation to find a value for A, we run into a problem. We have

y p ′(x) = −2Ae −2x
and

y p ″ = 4Ae −2x,
so we want

854

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

y″ + 5y′ + 6y = 3e −2x

4Ae −2x + 5⎛⎝−2Ae −2x⎞⎠ + 6Ae −2x = 3e −2x
4Ae −2x − 10Ae −2x + 6Ae −2x = 3e −2x
0 = 3e −2x,
which is not possible.
Looking closely, we see that, in this case, the general solution to the complementary equation is c 1 e −2x + c 2 e −3x. The

exponential function in r(x) is actually a solution to the complementary equation, so, as we just saw, all the terms on the

left side of the equation cancel out. We can still use the method of undetermined coefficients in this case, but we have to
alter our guess by multiplying it by x. Using the new guess, y p(x) = Axe −2x, we have

y p ′(x) = A⎛⎝e −2x − 2xe −2x⎞⎠
and

y p ″(x) = −4Ae −2x + 4Axe −2x.
Substitution gives

y″ + 5y′ + 6y = 3e −2x

⎛
−2x
+ 4Axe −2x⎞⎠ + 5⎛⎝Ae −2x − 2Axe −2x⎞⎠ + 6Axe −2x
⎝−4Ae

= 3e −2x

−4Ae −2x + 4Axe −2x + 5Ae −2x − 10Axe −2x + 6Axe −2x = 3e −2x
Ae −2x = 3e −2x.
So, A = 3 and y p(x) = 3xe −2x. This gives us the following general solution

y(x) = c 1 e −2x + c 2 e −3x + 3xe −2x.
Note that if xe −2x were also a solution to the complementary equation, we would have to multiply by x again, and we
would try y p(x) = Ax 2 e −2x.

Problem-Solving Strategy: Method of Undetermined Coefficients
1. Solve the complementary equation and write down the general solution.
2. Based on the form of r(x), make an initial guess for y p(x).
3. Check whether any term in the guess for y p(x) is a solution to the complementary equation. If so, multiply
the guess by x. Repeat this step until there are no terms in y p(x) that solve the complementary equation.
4. Substitute y p(x) into the differential equation and equate like terms to find values for the unknown
coefficients in y p(x).
5. Add the general solution to the complementary equation and the particular solution you just found to obtain
the general solution to the nonhomogeneous equation.

Solving Nonhomogeneous Equations
Find the general solutions to the following differential equations.
a.

y″ − 9y = −6cos3x

b.

x″ + 2x′ + x = 4e −t

c.

y″ − 2y′ + 5y = 10x 2 − 3x − 3

d.

y″ − 3y′ = −12t

Solution
a. The complementary equation is y″ − 9y = 0, which has the general solution c 1 e 3x + c 2 e −3x (step
1). Based on the form of r(x) = −6cos3x,

our initial guess for the particular solution is

y p(x) = Acos3x + Bsin3x (step 2). None of the terms in y p(x) solve the complementary equation, so
this is a valid guess (step 3).
Now we want to find values for A and B, so substitute y p into the differential equation. We have

y p ′(x) = −3Asin3x + 3Bcos3x and y p ″(x) = −9Acos3x − 9Bsin3x,
so we want to find values of A and B such that

y″ − 9y = −6cos3x
−9Acos3x − 9Bsin3x − 9(Acos3x + Bsin3x) = −6cos3x
−18Acos3x − 18Bsin3x = −6cos3x.
Therefore,

−18A = −6
−18B = 0.
⎛ ⎞

This gives A = 1 and B = 0, so y p(x) = ⎝1 ⎠ cos3x (step 4).

3

3

Putting everything together, we have the general solution

y(x) = c 1 e 3x + c 2 e −3x + 1 cos3x.
3

b. The complementary equation is x″ + 2x′ + x = 0, which has the general solution c 1 e −t + c 2 te −t
(step 1). Based on the form r(t) = 4e −t, our initial guess for the particular solution is x p(t) = Ae −t
(step 2). However, we see that this guess solves the complementary equation, so we must multiply by t,
which gives a new guess: x p(t) = Ate −t (step 3). Checking this new guess, we see that it, too, solves the
complementary equation, so we must multiply by t again, which gives x p(t) = At 2 e −t (step 3 again).
Now, checking this guess, we see that x p(t) does not solve the complementary equation, so this is a valid
guess (step 3 yet again).
We now want to find a value for A, so we substitute x p into the differential equation. We have

x p(t) = At 2 e −t, so
x p ′(t) = 2Ate −t − At 2 e −t

856

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

and x p ″(t) = 2Ae −t − 2Ate −t − ⎛⎝2Ate −t − At 2 e −t⎞⎠ = 2Ae −t − 4Ate −t + At 2 e −t.
Substituting into the differential equation, we want to find a value of A so that

x″ + 2x′ + x = 4e −t

2Ae −t − 4Ate −t + At 2 e −t + 2⎛⎝2Ate −t − At 2 e −t⎞⎠ + At 2 e −t = 4e −t

2Ae −t = 4e −t.
This gives A = 2, so x p(t) = 2t 2 e −t (step 4). Putting everything together, we have the general solution

x(t) = c 1 e −t + c 2 te −t + 2t 2 e −t.

c 1 e cos2x + c 2 e sin2x (step 1). Based on the form r(x) = 10x − 3x − 3, our initial guess for
the particular solution is y p(x) = Ax 2 + Bx + C (step 2). None of the terms in y p(x) solve the
complementary equation, so this is a valid guess (step 3). We now want to find values for A,

B, and
C, so we substitute y p into the differential equation. We have y p ′(x) = 2Ax + B and y p ″(x) = 2A,

so we want to find values of A,

B, and C such that
y″ − 2y′ + 5y = 10x 2 − 3x − 3

2A − 2(2Ax + B) + 5⎛⎝Ax 2 + Bx + C⎞⎠ = 10x 2 − 3x − 3

5Ax 2 + (5B − 4A)x + (5C − 2B + 2A) = 10x 2 − 3x − 3.
Therefore,

5A = 10
5B − 4A = −3
5C − 2B + 2A = −3.
This gives A = 2,

B = 1, and C = −1, so y p(x) = 2x 2 + x − 1 (step 4). Putting everything

together, we have the general solution

y(x) = c 1 e x cos2x + c 2 e x sin2x + 2x 2 + x − 1.
d. The complementary equation is y″ − 3y′ = 0, which has the general solution c 1 e 3t + c 2 (step 1).
Based on the form r(t) = −12t, our initial guess for the particular solution is y p(t) = At + B (step

2). However, we see that the constant term in this guess solves the complementary equation, so we must
multiply by t, which gives a new guess: y p(t) = At 2 + Bt (step 3). Checking this new guess, we see
that none of the terms in y p(t) solve the complementary equation, so this is a valid guess (step 3 again).
We now want to find values for A and B, so we substitute y p into the differential equation. We have

y p ′(t) = 2At + B and y p ″(t) = 2A, so we want to find values of A and B such that

857

y″ − 3y′ = −12t
2A − 3(2At + B) = −12t
−6At + (2A − 3B) = −12t.
Therefore,

−6A = −12
2A − 3B = 0.
This gives A = 2 and B = 4/3, so y p(t) = 2t 2 + (4/3)t (step 4). Putting everything together, we have
the general solution

y(t) = c 1 e 3t + c 2 + 2t 2 + 4 t.

Find the general solution to the following differential equations.

y″ + y′ − 6y = 52cos2t

Variation of Parameters
Sometimes, r(x) is not a combination of polynomials, exponentials, or sines and cosines. When this is the case, the method
of undetermined coefficients does not work, and we have to use another approach to find a particular solution to the
differential equation. We use an approach called the method of variation of parameters.
To simplify our calculations a little, we are going to divide the differential equation through by a, so we have a leading
coefficient of 1. Then the differential equation has the form

y″ + py′ + qy = r(x),
where p and q are constants.
If the general solution to the complementary equation is given by c 1 y 1(x) + c 2 y 2(x), we are going to look for a particular

solution of the form y p(x) = u(x)y 1(x) + v(x)y 2(x). In this case, we use the two linearly independent solutions to the
complementary equation to form our particular solution. However, we are assuming the coefficients are functions of x,
rather than constants. We want to find functions u(x) and v(x) such that y p(x) satisfies the differential equation. We have

y p = uy 1 + vy 2

y p ′ = u′ y 1 + uy 1 ′ + v′ y 2 + vy 2 ′

y p ″ = ⎛⎝u′ y 1 + v′ y 2⎞⎠′ + u′ y 1 ′ + uy 1 ″ + v′ y 2 ′ + vy 2 ″.
Substituting into the differential equation, we obtain

y p ″ + py p ′ + qy p = ⎡⎣⎛⎝u′ y 1 + v′ y 2⎞⎠′ + u′ y 1 ′ + uy 1 ″ + v′ y 2 ′ + vy 2 ″⎤⎦

+ p⎡⎣u′ y 1 + uy 1 ′ + v′ y 2 + vy 2 ′⎤⎦ + q[uy 1 + vy 2]

= u⎡⎣y 1 ″ + py 1 ′ + qy 1⎤⎦ + v⎡⎣y 2 ″ + py 2 ′ + qy 2⎤⎦

+ ⎛⎝u′ y 1 + v′ y 2⎞⎠′ + p⎛⎝u′ y 1 + v′ y 2⎞⎠ + ⎛⎝u′ y 1 ′ + v′ y 2 ′⎞⎠.

Note that y 1 and y 2 are solutions to the complementary equation, so the first two terms are zero. Thus, we have

858

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

⎛
⎝

u′ y 1 + v′ y 2⎞⎠′ + p⎛⎝u′ y 1 + v′ y 2⎞⎠ + ⎛⎝u′ y 1 ′ + v′ y 2 ′⎞⎠ = r(x).

If we simplify this equation by imposing the additional condition u′ y 1 + v′ y 2 = 0, the first two terms are zero, and this

reduces to u′ y 1 ′ + v′ y 2 ′ = r(x). So, with this additional condition, we have a system of two equations in two unknowns:

u′ y 1 + v′ y 2 = 0
u′ y 1 ′ + v′ y 2 ′ = r(x).
Solving this system gives us u′ and v′, which we can integrate to find u and v.
Then, y p(x) = u(x)y 1(x) + v(x)y 2(x) is a particular solution to the differential equation. Solving this system of equations
is sometimes challenging, so let’s take this opportunity to review Cramer’s rule, which allows us to solve the system of
equations using determinants.

a. The complementary equation is y″ − 2y′ + y = 0 with associated general solution c 1 e t + c 2 te t.

Therefore, y 1(t) = e t and y 2(t) = te t. Calculating the derivatives, we get y 1 ′(t) = e t and

7.3.4 Solve a second-order differential equation representing charge and current in an RLC
series circuit.
We saw in the chapter introduction that second-order linear differential equations are used to model many situations in
physics and engineering. In this section, we look at how this works for systems of an object with mass attached to a vertical
spring and an electric circuit containing a resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor connected in series. Models such as these
can be used to approximate other more complicated situations; for example, bonds between atoms or molecules are often
modeled as springs that vibrate, as described by these same differential equations.

Simple Harmonic Motion
Consider a mass suspended from a spring attached to a rigid support. (This is commonly called a spring-mass system.)
Gravity is pulling the mass downward and the restoring force of the spring is pulling the mass upward. As shown in Figure
7.2, when these two forces are equal, the mass is said to be at the equilibrium position. If the mass is displaced from
equilibrium, it oscillates up and down. This behavior can be modeled by a second-order constant-coefficient differential
equation.

Figure 7.2 A spring in its natural position (a), at equilibrium with a mass m attached (b), and
in oscillatory motion (c).

Let x(t) denote the displacement of the mass from equilibrium. Note that for spring-mass systems of this type, it is
customary to adopt the convention that down is positive. Thus, a positive displacement indicates the mass is below the
equilibrium point, whereas a negative displacement indicates the mass is above equilibrium. Displacement is usually given
in feet in the English system or meters in the metric system.
Consider the forces acting on the mass. The force of gravity is given by mg. In the English system, mass is in slugs and
the acceleration resulting from gravity is in feet per second squared. The acceleration resulting from gravity is constant, so
in the English system, g = 32 ft/sec2. Recall that 1 slug-foot/sec2 is a pound, so the expression mg can be expressed in
pounds. Metric system units are kilograms for mass and m/sec2 for gravitational acceleration. In the metric system, we have
g = 9.8 m/sec2.
According to Hooke’s law, the restoring force of the spring is proportional to the displacement and acts in the opposite

864

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

direction from the displacement, so the restoring force is given by −k(s + x). The spring constant is given in pounds per
foot in the English system and in newtons per meter in the metric system.
Now, by Newton’s second law, the sum of the forces on the system (gravity plus the restoring force) is equal to mass times
acceleration, so we have

mx″ = −k(s + x) + mg
= −ks − kx + mg.
However, by the way we have defined our equilibrium position, mg = ks, the differential equation becomes

mx″ + kx = 0.
It is convenient to rearrange this equation and introduce a new variable, called the angular frequency, ω. Letting

ω = k/m, we can write the equation as
x″ + ω 2 x = 0.

(7.5)

x(t) = c 1 cosωt + c 2 sinωt,

(7.6)

This differential equation has the general solution

which gives the position of the mass at any point in time. The motion of the mass is called simple harmonic motion. The

ω (Figure

period of this motion (the time it takes to complete one oscillation) is T = 2π

the equilibrium position with an upward velocity of 16 ft/sec. What is the period of the motion?

Solution
We first need to find the spring constant. We have

mg = ks

⎛ ⎞
2 = k⎝1 ⎠
2
k = 4.

We also know that weight W equals the product of mass m and the acceleration due to gravity g. In English units,
the acceleration due to gravity is 32 ft/sec2.

W = mg
2 = m(32)
m = 1
16
Thus, the differential equation representing this system is

1 x″ + 4x = 0.
16
Multiplying through by 16, we get x″ + 64x = 0, which can also be written in the form x″ + (8 2)x = 0. This
equation has the general solution

x(t) = c 1 cos(8t) + c 2 sin(8t).
The mass was released from the equilibrium position, so x(0) = 0, and it had an initial upward velocity of 16
ft/sec, so x′(0) = −16. Applying these initial conditions to solve for c 1 and c 2. gives

x(t) = −2sin8t.
The period of this motion is 2π = π sec.

7.15 A 200-g mass stretches a spring 5 cm. Find the equation of motion of the mass if it is released from rest
from a position 10 cm below the equilibrium position. What is the frequency of this motion?

Writing the general solution in the form x(t) = c 1 cos(ωt) + c 2 sin(ωt) has some advantages. It is easy to see the link
between the differential equation and the solution, and the period and frequency of motion are evident. This form of the
function tells us very little about the amplitude of the motion, however. In some situations, we may prefer to write the
solution in the form

x(t) = Asin ⎛⎝ωt + ϕ⎞⎠.

(7.7)

Although the link to the differential equation is not as explicit in this case, the period and frequency of motion are still
evident. Furthermore, the amplitude of the motion, A, is obvious in this form of the function. The constant ϕ is called a
phase shift and has the effect of shifting the graph of the function to the left or right.
To convert the solution to this form, we want to find the values of A and ϕ such that

c 1 cos(ωt) + c 2 sin(ωt) = Asin ⎛⎝ωt + ϕ⎞⎠.
We first apply the trigonometric identity

sin(α + β) = sinαcos β + cosαsin β

866

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

to get

c 1 cos(ωt) + c 2 sin(ωt) = A⎛⎝sin(ωt)cosϕ + cos(ωt)sinϕ⎞⎠
= Asinϕ(cos(ωt)) + Acosϕ⎛⎝sin(ωt)⎞⎠.
Thus,

c 1 = Asinϕ and c 2 = Acosϕ.
If we square both of these equations and add them together, we get

c 21 + c 22 = A 2 sin ϕ + A 2 cos ϕ
= A 2 ⎛⎝sin 2 ϕ + cos 2 ϕ⎞⎠
= A 2.
Thus,

A = c 21 + c 22.
Now, to find ϕ, go back to the equations for c 1 and c 2, but this time, divide the first equation by the second equation
to get

c1
Asinϕ
c 2 = Acosϕ
= tanϕ.
Then,

c
tanϕ = c 1 .
2

We summarize this finding in the following theorem.

Theorem 7.5: Solution to the Equation for Simple Harmonic Motion
The function x(t) = c 1 cos(ωt) + c 2 sin(ωt) can be written in the form x(t) = Asin ⎛⎝ωt + ϕ⎞⎠, where A = c 21 + c 22

c

and tanϕ = c 1 .

Note that when using the formula tanϕ = c 1 to find ϕ, we must take care to ensure ϕ is in the right quadrant (Figure

Note that both c 1 and c 2 are positive, so ϕ is in the first quadrant. Thus,

Damped Vibrations
With the model just described, the motion of the mass continues indefinitely. Clearly, this doesn’t happen in the real world.
In the real world, there is almost always some friction in the system, which causes the oscillations to die off slowly—an
effect called damping. So now let’s look at how to incorporate that damping force into our differential equation.
Physical spring-mass systems almost always have some damping as a result of friction, air resistance, or a physical damper,
called a dashpot (a pneumatic cylinder; see Figure 7.5).

Figure 7.5 A dashpot is a pneumatic cylinder that dampens
the motion of an oscillating system.

Because damping is primarily a friction force, we assume it is proportional to the velocity of the mass and acts in the
opposite direction. So the damping force is given by −bx′ for some constant b > 0. Again applying Newton’s second law,
the differential equation becomes

mx″ + bx′ + kx = 0.
Then the associated characteristic equation is

mλ 2 + bλ + k = 0.
Applying the quadratic formula, we have
2
λ = −b ± b − 4mk .
2m

Just as in Second-Order Linear Equations we consider three cases, based on whether the characteristic equation has
distinct real roots, a repeated real root, or complex conjugate roots.

Case 1: b 2 > 4mk
In this case, we say the system is overdamped. The general solution has the form
λ t

λ t

x(t) = c 1 e 1 + c 2 e 2 ,
where both λ 1 and λ 2 are less than zero. Because the exponents are negative, the displacement decays to zero over time,
usually quite quickly. Overdamped systems do not oscillate (no more than one change of direction), but simply move back
toward the equilibrium position. Figure 7.6 shows what typical critically damped behavior looks like.

Figure 7.6 Behavior of an overdamped spring-mass system, with no change in direction (a) and only one change
in direction (b).

Example 7.19
Overdamped Spring-Mass System
A 16-lb mass is attached to a 10-ft spring. When the mass comes to rest in the equilibrium position, the spring
measures 15 ft 4 in. The system is immersed in a medium that imparts a damping force equal to 5 times the

2

instantaneous velocity of the mass. Find the equation of motion if the mass is pushed upward from the equilibrium
position with an initial upward velocity of 5 ft/sec. What is the position of the mass after 10 sec? Its velocity?

Solution

⎛

⎞

The mass stretches the spring 5 ft 4 in., or 16 ft. Thus, 16 = ⎝16 ⎠k, so k = 3. We also have m = 16 = 1 ,

2

Multiplying through by 2 gives x″ + 5x′ + 6x = 0, which has the general solution

x(t) = c 1 e −2t + c 2 e −3t.
Applying the initial conditions, x(0) = 0 and x′(0) = −5, we get

x(t) = −5e −2t + 5e −3t.
After 10 sec the mass is at position

x(10) = −5e −20 + 5e −30 ≈ − 1.0305 × 10 −8 ≈ 0,
so it is, effectively, at the equilibrium position. We have x′(t) = 10e −2t − 15e −3t, so after 10 sec the mass is
moving at a velocity of

x′(10) = 10e −20 − 15e −30 ≈ 2.061 × 10 −8 ≈ 0.
After only 10 sec, the mass is barely moving.

7.17 A 2-kg mass is attached to a spring with spring constant 24 N/m. The system is then immersed in a
medium imparting a damping force equal to 16 times the instantaneous velocity of the mass. Find the equation
of motion if it is released from rest at a point 40 cm below equilibrium.
Case 2: b 2 = 4mk
In this case, we say the system is critically damped. The general solution has the form
λ t

λ t

x(t) = c 1 e 1 + c 2 te 1 ,
where λ 1 is less than zero. The motion of a critically damped system is very similar to that of an overdamped system. It
does not oscillate. However, with a critically damped system, if the damping is reduced even a little, oscillatory behavior
results. From a practical perspective, physical systems are almost always either overdamped or underdamped (case 3, which
we consider next). It is impossible to fine-tune the characteristics of a physical system so that b 2 and 4mk are exactly
equal. Figure 7.7 shows what typical critically damped behavior looks like.

with an upward velocity of 3 m/sec.

Solution
We have mg = 1(9.8) = 0.2k, so k = 49. Then, the differential equation is

x″ + 14x′ + 49x = 0,
which has general solution

x(t) = c 1 e −7t + c 2 te −7t.
Applying the initial conditions x(0) = 0 and x′(0) = −3 gives

x(t) = −3te −7t.

7.18 A 1-lb weight stretches a spring 6 in., and the system is attached to a dashpot that imparts a damping
force equal to half the instantaneous velocity of the mass. Find the equation of motion if the mass is released

Case 3: b 2 < 4mk
In this case, we say the system is underdamped. The general solution has the form

x(t) = e αt ⎛⎝c 1 cos ⎛⎝βt⎞⎠ + c 2 sin ⎛⎝βt⎞⎠⎞⎠,
where α is less than zero. Underdamped systems do oscillate because of the sine and cosine terms in the solution. However,
the exponential term dominates eventually, so the amplitude of the oscillations decreases over time. Figure 7.8 shows what
typical underdamped behavior looks like.

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

Figure 7.9 (credit: modification of work by nSeika, Flickr)

For motocross riders, the suspension systems on their motorcycles are very important. The off-road courses on
which they ride often include jumps, and losing control of the motorcycle when they land could cost them the
race.
This suspension system can be modeled as a damped spring-mass system. We define our frame of reference with
respect to the frame of the motorcycle. Assume the end of the shock absorber attached to the motorcycle frame is
fixed. Then, the “mass” in our spring-mass system is the motorcycle wheel. We measure the position of the wheel
with respect to the motorcycle frame. This may seem counterintuitive, since, in many cases, it is actually the
motorcycle frame that moves, but this frame of reference preserves the development of the differential equation
that was done earlier. As with earlier development, we define the downward direction to be positive.
When the motorcycle is lifted by its frame, the wheel hangs freely and the spring is uncompressed. This is the
spring’s natural position. When the motorcycle is placed on the ground and the rider mounts the motorcycle, the
spring compresses and the system is in the equilibrium position (Figure 7.10).

Figure 7.10 We can use a spring-mass system to model a motorcycle suspension.

873

874

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

This system can be modeled using the same differential equation we used before:

mx″ + bx′ + kx = 0.
A motocross motorcycle weighs 204 lb, and we assume a rider weight of 180 lb. When the rider mounts the
motorcycle, the suspension compresses 4 in., then comes to rest at equilibrium. The suspension system provides
damping equal to 240 times the instantaneous vertical velocity of the motorcycle (and rider).
a. Set up the differential equation that models the behavior of the motorcycle suspension system.
b. We are interested in what happens when the motorcycle lands after taking a jump. Let time t = 0 denote
the time when the motorcycle first contacts the ground. If the motorcycle hits the ground with a velocity
of 10 ft/sec downward, find the equation of motion of the motorcycle after the jump.
c. Graph the equation of motion over the first second after the motorcycle hits the ground.

Solution
a. We have defined equilibrium to be the point where mg = ks, so we have

mg = ks

⎛ ⎞
384 = k⎝1 ⎠
3
k = 1152.

We also have

W = mg
384 = m(32)
m = 12.
Therefore, the differential equation that models the behavior of the motorcycle suspension is

12x″ + 240x′ + 1152x = 0.
Dividing through by 12, we get

x″ + 20x′ + 96x = 0.
b. The differential equation found in part a. has the general solution

x(t) = c 1 e −8t + c 2 e −12t.
Now, to determine our initial conditions, we consider the position and velocity of the motorcycle wheel
when the wheel first contacts the ground. Since the motorcycle was in the air prior to contacting the
ground, the wheel was hanging freely and the spring was uncompressed. Therefore the wheel is 4 in.
⎛1 ⎞
1
⎝3 ft⎠ below the equilibrium position (with respect to the motorcycle frame), and we have x(0) = 3 .

According to the problem statement, the motorcycle has a velocity of 10 ft/sec downward when the

motorcycle contacts the ground, so x′(0) = 10. Applying these initial conditions, we get c 1 = 7 and
⎛ ⎞
c 2 = −⎝19 ⎠, so the equation of motion is

x(t) = 7 e −8t − 19 e −12t.

Landing Vehicle
NASA is planning a mission to Mars. To save money, engineers have decided to adapt one of the moon landing
vehicles for the new mission. However, they are concerned about how the different gravitational forces will affect the
suspension system that cushions the craft when it touches down. The acceleration resulting from gravity on the moon
is 1.6 m/sec2, whereas on Mars it is 3.7 m/sec2.
The suspension system on the craft can be modeled as a damped spring-mass system. In this case, the spring is below
the moon lander, so the spring is slightly compressed at equilibrium, as shown in Figure 7.12.

Figure 7.12 The landing craft suspension can be represented as a damped spring-mass system. (credit “lander”:
NASA)

We retain the convention that down is positive. Despite the new orientation, an examination of the forces affecting
the lander shows that the same differential equation can be used to model the position of the landing craft relative to
equilibrium:

mx″ + bx′ + kx = 0,
where m is the mass of the lander, b is the damping coefficient, and k is the spring constant.
1. The lander has a mass of 15,000 kg and the spring is 2 m long when uncompressed. The lander is designed
to compress the spring 0.5 m to reach the equilibrium position under lunar gravity. The dashpot imparts a
damping force equal to 48,000 times the instantaneous velocity of the lander. Set up the differential equation
that models the motion of the lander when the craft lands on the moon.
2. Let time t = 0 denote the instant the lander touches down. The rate of descent of the lander can be controlled
by the crew, so that it is descending at a rate of 2 m/sec when it touches down. Find the equation of motion of
the lander on the moon.
3. If the lander is traveling too fast when it touches down, it could fully compress the spring and “bottom out.”
Bottoming out could damage the landing craft and must be avoided at all costs. Graph the equation of motion
found in part 2. If the spring is 0.5 m long when fully compressed, will the lander be in danger of bottoming
out?
4. Assuming NASA engineers make no adjustments to the spring or the damper, how far does the lander compress
the spring to reach the equilibrium position under Martian gravity?
5. If the lander crew uses the same procedures on Mars as on the moon, and keeps the rate of descent to 2 m/sec,
will the lander bottom out when it lands on Mars?
6. What adjustments, if any, should the NASA engineers make to use the lander safely on Mars?

Forced Vibrations
The last case we consider is when an external force acts on the system. In the case of the motorcycle suspension system, for
example, the bumps in the road act as an external force acting on the system. Another example is a spring hanging from a
support; if the support is set in motion, that motion would be considered an external force on the system. We model these
forced systems with the nonhomogeneous differential equation

(7.8)

where the external force is represented by the f (t) term. As we saw in Nonhomogenous Linear Equations,
differential equations such as this have solutions of the form

x(t) = c 1 x 1(t) + c 2 x 2(t) + x p(t),
where c 1 x 1(t) + c 2 x 2(t) is the general solution to the complementary equation and x p(t) is a particular solution to the
nonhomogeneous equation. If the system is damped, lim c 1 x 1(t) + c 2 x 2(t) = 0. Since these terms do not affect the longt→∞

term behavior of the system, we call this part of the solution the transient solution. The long-term behavior of the system is
determined by x p(t), so we call this part of the solution the steady-state solution.
This website (http://www.openstaxcollege.org/l/20_Oscillations) shows a simulation of forced
vibrations.

Example 7.23
Forced Vibrations
A mass of 1 slug stretches a spring 2 ft and comes to rest at equilibrium. The system is attached to a dashpot
that imparts a damping force equal to eight times the instantaneous velocity of the mass. Find the equation of
motion if an external force equal to f (t) = 8sin(4t) is applied to the system beginning at time t = 0. What is
the transient solution? What is the steady-state solution?

Solution
We have mg = 1(32) = 2k, so k = 16 and the differential equation is

x″ + 8x′ + 16x = 8sin(4t).
The general solution to the complementary equation is

c 1 e −4t + c 2 te −4t.
Assuming a particular solution of the form x p(t) = Acos(4t) + Bsin(4t) and using the method of undetermined
coefficients, we find x p(t) = − 1 cos(4t), so

4

x(t) = c 1 e −4t + c 2 te −4t − 1 cos(4t).
4
At t = 0, the mass is at rest in the equilibrium position, so x(0) = x′(0) = 0. Applying these initial conditions
to solve for c 1 and c 2, we get

x(t) = 1 e −4t + te −4t − 1 cos(4t).
4
4
The transient solution is 1 e −4t + te −4t. The steady-state solution is − 1 cos(4t).

Resonance
Consider an undamped system exhibiting simple harmonic motion. In the real world, we never truly have an undamped
system; –some damping always occurs. For theoretical purposes, however, we could imagine a spring-mass system
contained in a vacuum chamber. With no air resistance, the mass would continue to move up and down indefinitely.
The frequency of the resulting motion, given by f = 1 = ω , is called the natural frequency of the system. If an

T

2π

external force acting on the system has a frequency close to the natural frequency of the system, a phenomenon called
resonance results. The external force reinforces and amplifies the natural motion of the system.
1. Consider the differential equation x″ + x = 0. Find the general solution. What is the natural frequency of the
system?
2. Now suppose this system is subjected to an external force given by f (t) = 5cost. Solve the initial-value
problem x″ + x = 5cost,

x(0) = 0, x′(0) = 1.

3. Graph the solution. What happens to the behavior of the system over time?
4. In the real world, there is always some damping. However, if the damping force is weak, and the external
force is strong enough, real-world systems can still exhibit resonance. One of the most famous examples of
resonance is the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge on November 7, 1940. The bridge had exhibited
strange behavior ever since it was built. The roadway had a strange “bounce” to it. On the day it collapsed, a
strong windstorm caused the roadway to twist and ripple violently. The bridge was unable to withstand these
forces and it ultimately collapsed. Experts believe the windstorm exerted forces on the bridge that were very
close to its natural frequency, and the resulting resonance ultimately shook the bridge apart.

During the short time the Tacoma Narrows Bridge stood, it became quite a tourist attraction. Several
people were on site the day the bridge collapsed, and one of them caught the collapse on film. Watch
the video (http://www.openstaxcollege.org/l/20_TacomaNarro2) to see the collapse.
5. Another real-world example of resonance is a singer shattering a crystal wineglass when she sings just the right
note. When someone taps a crystal wineglass or wets a finger and runs it around the rim, a tone can be heard.
That note is created by the wineglass vibrating at its natural frequency. If a singer then sings that same note at
a high enough volume, the glass shatters as a result of resonance.
The TV show Mythbusters aired an episode on this phenomenon. Visit this website

described the experience. Watch this video (http://www.openstaxcollege.org/l/20_glass2) for

The RLC Series Circuit
Consider an electrical circuit containing a resistor, an inductor, and a capacitor, as shown in Figure 7.10. Such a circuit is
called an RLC series circuit. RLC circuits are used in many electronic systems, most notably as tuners in AM/FM radios.
The tuning knob varies the capacitance of the capacitor, which in turn tunes the radio. Such circuits can be modeled by
second-order, constant-coefficient differential equations.

880

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

Let I(t) denote the current in the RLC circuit and q(t) denote the charge on the capacitor. Furthermore, let L denote
inductance in henrys (H), R denote resistance in ohms (Ω), and C denote capacitance in farads (F). Last, let E(t) denote
electric potential in volts (V).
Kirchhoff’s voltage rule states that the sum of the voltage drops around any closed loop must be zero. So, we need to
consider the voltage drops across the inductor (denoted E L ), the resistor (denoted E R ), and the capacitor (denoted E C
). Because the RLC circuit shown in Figure 7.10 includes a voltage source, E(t), which adds voltage to the circuit, we
have E L + E R + E C = E(t).
We present the formulas below without further development. Those of you interested in the derivation of these formulas
should consult a physics text. Using Faraday’s law and Lenz’s law, the voltage drop across an inductor can be shown to be
proportional to the instantaneous rate of change of current, with proportionality constant L. Thus,

E L = L dI .
dt
Next, according to Ohm’s law, the voltage drop across a resistor is proportional to the current passing through the resistor,
with proportionality constant R. Therefore,

E R = RI.
Last, the voltage drop across a capacitor is proportional to the charge, q, on the capacitor, with proportionality constant
1/C. Thus,

E C = 1 q.
C
Adding these terms together, we get

L dI + RI + 1 q = E(t).

Noting that I = ⎛⎝dq⎞⎠/(dt), this becomes

Mathematically, this system is analogous to the spring-mass systems we have been examining in this section.

same differential equation as a mass-spring system.

The general solution to the complementary equation is

e −3t ⎛⎝c 1 cos(3t) + c 2 sin(3t)⎞⎠.
Assume a particular solution of the form q p = A, where A is a constant. Using the method of undetermined
coefficients, we find A = 10. So,

q(t) = e −3t ⎛⎝c 1 cos(3t) + c 2 sin(3t)⎞⎠ + 10.
Applying the initial conditions q(0) = 0 and i(0) = ⎛⎝⎛⎝dq⎞⎠/(dt)⎞⎠(0) = 9, we find c 1 = −10 and c 2 = −7. So
the charge on the capacitor is

q(t) = −10e −3t cos(3t) − 7e −3t sin(3t) + 10.
Looking closely at this function, we see the first two terms will decay over time (as a result of the negative
exponent in the exponential function). Therefore, the capacitor eventually approaches a steady-state charge of 10
C.

7.4.1 Use power series to solve first-order and second-order differential equations.
In Introduction to Power Series (http://cnx.org/content/m53760/latest/) , we studied how functions can be

represented as power series, y(x) = ∑ a n x n. We also saw that we can find series representations of the derivatives

n=1

y″(x) = ∑ n(n − 1)a n x n − 2. In some cases, these power series representations can be used to find solutions to

differential equations.
Be aware that this subject is given only a very brief treatment in this text. Most introductory differential equations textbooks
include an entire chapter on power series solutions. This text has only a single section on the topic, so several important
issues are not addressed here, particularly issues related to existence of solutions. The examples and exercises in this section
were chosen for which power solutions exist. However, it is not always the case that power solutions exist. Those of you
interested in a more rigorous treatment of this topic should consult a differential equations text.

Because power series expansions of functions are unique, this equation can be true only if the coefficients
of each power of x are zero. So we have

(n + 2)(n + 1)a n + 2 − a n = 0 for n = 0, 1, 2,….
This recurrence relationship allows us to express each coefficient a n in terms of the coefficient two
terms earlier. This yields one expression for even values of n and another expression for odd values of n.

Analysis for part a.
As expected for a second-order differential equation, this solution depends on two arbitrary constants.
However, note that our differential equation is a constant-coefficient differential equation, yet the power
series solution does not appear to have the familiar form (containing exponential functions) that we are
used to seeing. Furthermore, since y(x) = c 1 e x + c 2 e −x is the general solution to this equation, we must
be able to write any solution in this form, and it is not clear whether the power series solution we just
found can, in fact, be written in that form.
Fortunately, after writing the power series representations of e x and e −x, and doing some algebra, we
find that if we choose

the scope of this course, but we get a little taste of the topic here so we can see how series solutions to differential equations
are used in real-world applications. The Bessel equation of order n is given by

KEY CONCEPTS
7.1 Second-Order Linear Equations
• Second-order differential equations can be classified as linear or nonlinear, homogeneous or nonhomogeneous.
• To find a general solution for a homogeneous second-order differential equation, we must find two linearly
independent solutions. If y 1(x) and y 2(x) are linearly independent solutions to a second-order, linear,
homogeneous differential equation, then the general solution is given by

y(x) = c 1 y 1(x) + c 2 y 2(x).
• To solve homogeneous second-order differential equations with constant coefficients, find the roots of the
characteristic equation. The form of the general solution varies depending on whether the characteristic equation
has distinct, real roots; a single, repeated real root; or complex conjugate roots.
• Initial conditions or boundary conditions can then be used to find the specific solution to a differential equation that
satisfies those conditions, except when there is no solution or infinitely many solutions.

7.2 Nonhomogeneous Linear Equations
• To solve a nonhomogeneous linear second-order differential equation, first find the general solution to the
complementary equation, then find a particular solution to the nonhomogeneous equation.
• Let y p(x) be any particular solution to the nonhomogeneous linear differential equation

a 2 (x)y″ + a 1 (x)y′ + a 0 (x)y = r(x),
and let c 1 y 1(x) + c 2 y 2(x) denote the general solution to the complementary equation. Then, the general solution
to the nonhomogeneous equation is given by

y(x) = c 1 y 1(x) + c 2 y 2(x) + y p(x).
• When r(x) is a combination of polynomials, exponential functions, sines, and cosines, use the method of
undetermined coefficients to find the particular solution. To use this method, assume a solution in the same form as
r(x), multiplying by x as necessary until the assumed solution is linearly independent of the general solution to
the complementary equation. Then, substitute the assumed solution into the differential equation to find values for
the coefficients.
• When r(x) is not a combination of polynomials, exponential functions, or sines and cosines, use the method of
variation of parameters to find the particular solution. This method involves using Cramer’s rule or another suitable

894

Chapter 7 | Second-Order Differential Equations

technique to find functions u′(x) and v′(x) satisfying

u′ y 1 + v′ y 2 = 0
u′ y 1 ′ + v′ y 2 ′ = r(x).
Then, y p(x) = u(x)y 1(x) + v(x)y 2(x) is a particular solution to the differential equation.

7.3 Applications
• Second-order constant-coefficient differential equations can be used to model spring-mass systems.
• An examination of the forces on a spring-mass system results in a differential equation of the form

mx″ + bx′ + kx = f (t),
where m represents the mass, b is the coefficient of the damping force, k is the spring constant, and f (t)
represents any net external forces on the system.
• If b = 0, there is no damping force acting on the system, and simple harmonic motion results. If b ≠ 0, the
behavior of the system depends on whether b 2 − 4mk > 0,

b 2 − 4mk = 0, or b 2 − 4mk < 0.

• If b 2 − 4mk > 0, the system is overdamped and does not exhibit oscillatory behavior.
• If b 2 − 4mk = 0, the system is critically damped. It does not exhibit oscillatory behavior, but any slight reduction
in the damping would result in oscillatory behavior.
• If b 2 − 4mk < 0, the system is underdamped. It exhibits oscillatory behavior, but the amplitude of the oscillations
decreases over time.
• If f (t) ≠ 0, the solution to the differential equation is the sum of a transient solution and a steady-state solution.
The steady-state solution governs the long-term behavior of the system.
• The charge on the capacitor in an RLC series circuit can also be modeled with a second-order constant-coefficient
differential equation of the form

L

d2 q
dq
+ R + 1 q = E(t),
2
dt C
dt

where L is the inductance, R is the resistance, C is the capacitance, and E(t) is the voltage source.

7.4 Series Solutions of Differential Equations
• Power series representations of functions can sometimes be used to find solutions to differential equations.
• Differentiate the power series term by term and substitute into the differential equation to find relationships between
the power series coefficients.

4.10. The polynomials g(x) = 2x 2 and h(y) = y 3 are continuous at every real number; therefore, by the product of continuous
functions theorem, f (x, y) = 2x 2 y 3 is continuous at every point (x, y) in the xy-plane. Furthermore, any constant function is
continuous everywhere, so g(x, y) = 3 is continuous at every point (x, y) in the xy-plane. Therefore, f (x, y) = 2x 2 y 3 + 3
is continuous at every point (x, y) in the xy-plane. Last, h(x) = x 4 is continuous at every real number x, so by the continuity

Answer Key

361. a. T(u, v) = ⎛⎝g(u, v), h(u, v)⎞⎠, x = g(u, v) = u 3,

and y = h(u, v) = v 3. The functions g and h are continuous

and differentiable, and the partial derivatives g u (u, v) = 3u 2,
continuous on S; b. T(0, 0) = (0, 0),

T(1, 0) = (1, 0),

g v (u, v) = 0,

h u (u, v) = 0, and h v (u, v) = 3v 2 are

T(0, 1) = (0, 1), and T(1, 1) = (1, 1); c. R is the unit

square in the xy-plane; see the figure in the answer to the previous exercise.
363. T is not one-to-one: two points of S have the same image. Indeed, T(−2, 0) = T(2, 0) = (16, 4).

365. T is one-to-one: We argue by contradiction. T(u 1, v 1) = T(u 2, v 2) implies 2u 1 − v 1 = 2u 2 − v 2 and u 1 = u 2. Thus,

u 1 = u 2 and v 1 = v 2.
