//    Write a Java class called MySet,
//    TODO REQUIREMENTS - that stores a collection of Objects (in an array) along
//        with the current size of the collection.
//    TODO REQUIREMENTS - An instance of MySet should behave just like a set:
//        to the caller of the methods, there is no order associated with the items in the
//        MySet object.
//    TODO REQUIREMENTS - Furthermore, there should not be two items in the MySet that are
//        .equals() to each other as a result of any of the MySet methods.
//
//    TODO - Provide public methods isEmpty, makeEmpty, size, insert, remove, and
//        isPresent.
//    TODO REQUIREMENTS - remove(x) should remove an item from the array that is equal to x (as
//        defined by equals).
//    TODO REQUIREMENTS - isPresent(x) returns true if and only if an Object that is equal
//        to x (as defined by equals) is present in the collection.
//    TODO - Carefully think about what the
//        parameters to the above methods are.
//    TODO - Write a method called test that makes calls to
//        your methods to demonstrate that they behave correctly. Be sure to test boundary
//        cases, such as inserting an item when the array is full.
